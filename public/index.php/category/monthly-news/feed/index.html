				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s a first-of-its-kind culinary experience in the Caribbean: a hotel with its own fish market. It’s the brainchild of the Zemi Beach House hotel in Anguilla: each week, the Zemi Beach House Fish Market sees local fishermen bring the fresh catch of the day to the shores of Shoal Bay. The fish is then barbecued by the hotel’s culinary team and served to guests, with a spectacular view of Shoal Bay. The market, which is every Friday at 12 PM, also features periodic live music by local artists like the Musical Brothers. Zemi Beach House opened earlier this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the Dominican Republic’s sweetest deal. And if you’re a chocolate lover (and who isn’t?) it just might be reason enough to book a stay at RIU’s all-inclusive resorts in the Dominican Republic’s Punta Cana. That’s because guests at the Spanish all-inclusive resort chain’s playgrounds have exclusive access to Chocolate &amp; CIA, a chocolate workshop and boutique on Caribbean Street in the beachfront complex that houses RIU Naiboa, RIU Bambu, RIU Palace Bavaro, RIU Palace Macao and RIU Palace Punta Cana. The two-month old store is a mecca for chocoholics, who can learn how farmers in the D.R. (which is one of the world’s largest producers of organic cacao) cultivate their crops before export to international brands such as Lindt, Nestlé, Valrhona and Godiva.</p>

But Seeto, 50, has more in common with another celebrity chef: Jamie Oliver. Like the British chef, he has a very successful TV series and a book in the pipeline. But it&#8217;s his mission to improve the cooking standards, diet, health and life expectancy of his adopted countrymen and women that bears most similarity with Oliver.</p>
