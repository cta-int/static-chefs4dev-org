				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Owners and senior executives of the largest hotels and resorts in Jamaica under the Inverotel umbrella, an association representing Spanish hoteliers, have committed to expanding their purchasing and support for local products and services.</p>
<p>The hotel operators met with Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett and other local tourism officials in Spain&#8217;s capital city, Madrid.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Ministry of Tourism, the Spanish investors made the commitment while stressing the importance of quality, good pricing and consistency in the items.</p>
<p>The investors also indicated a strong willingness to work with the Jamaican Government in partnering with local businesses on the establishment of efficient and well run farming operations to better supply the tourism industry.</p>
<p>The Spanish investors included the owners&#8217; of three of the largest hotels in the Jamaica — Grupo Pinero, owners of Bahia Principe, Encarna Pinero, who also chairs Inverotel; Iberostar&#8217;s, Miguel Fluxa; and Grand Palladium&#8217;s, Abel Matutes.</p>
<p>Bartlett revealed that major findings of a recent study indicated that Jamaica&#8217;s tourism sector total value of demand for agricultural products amounted to $39.6 billion and a whopping $352 billion for manufactured products.</p>
<p>The tourism demand study was designed to identify the existing/potential demand in the tourism sector for goods and services across local sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing and entertainment. The study was conducted through the Ministry&#8217;s Tourism Linkages Council.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p_brief">1.5 billion international tourist arrivals were recorded in 2019, globally. A 4% increase on the previous year which is also forecast for 2020, confirming tourism as a leading and resilient economic sector, especially in view of current uncertainties. By the same token, this calls for such growth to be managed responsibly so as to best seize the opportunities tourism can generate for communities around the world.</p>
<p>According to the first comprehensive report on global tourism numbers and trends of the new decade, the latest UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, this represents the tenth consecutive year of growth.</p>
<p>All regions saw a rise in international arrivals in 2019. However, uncertainty surrounding Brexit, the collapse of Thomas Cook, geopolitical and social tensions and the global economic slowdown all contributed to a slower growth in 2019, when compared to the exceptional rates of 2017 and 2018. This slowdown affected mainly advanced economies and particularly Europe and Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, growth of 3% to 4% is predicted for 2020, an outlook reflected in the latest UNWTO Confidence Index which shows a cautious optimism: 47% of participants believe tourism will perform better and 43% at the same level of 2019. Major sporting events, including the Tokyo Olympics, and cultural events such as Expo 2020 Dubai are expected to have a positive impact on the sector.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heard of agro (agricultural) tourism? See the new Palm House Boutique Resort &amp; Organic Farm for glorious clarification. Sitting pretty on 3,800 hectares of organic farmland, The Palm House is situated on the north-west coast of Efate Island, 45 minutes from capital Port Vila. Formerly a private sanctuary, the property has been expanded to encompass a handful of tropical-luxe villas and a true paddock-to-plate dining experience. The Palm House team is the real deal — as committed to the economic stability of the local people as they are to protecting the lush natural environment. On their Tukutuk family farm they run 2,000 head of grass-fed cattle, plus goats and sheep, as well as managing Vanuatu’s only prawn operation and producing their own organic-certified coconut oil! Loving that ‘agro’ angle already!</p>
<p>This unique Vanuatu escape is designed with couples in mind. Explore 12 kilometres of private beaches and reefs and loll about in the large swimming pool before retiring to the relaxed vibe of your made-for-two villa. Stylishly equipped with outdoor showers, Diptyque candles, and Smeg mini bar fridges, the villas even offer a custom-made rattan cot if you’re bringing your babe to paradise. Take your sundowner on the verandah and drink in the Pacific Ocean vistas then adjourn to the resort’s sun-drenched, breeze-swept dining area and settle in for a memorable feast, sourced and created onsite.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cabo Verde is among the most attractive tourist markets in West Africa at a time when the continent is increasingly attracting tourism investment, according to an assessment released by Hospitality and Tourism International (HTI) Consulting.</p>
<p>The assessment, released during the African Property Investment (API) Summit, which took place on 2 and 3 October in Johannesburg, said that the main investment destinations in the hotel industry in West Africa are, besides Cabo Verde, Senegal, Benin and Ghana.</p>
<p>“Other markets offer opportunities, but the potential for security or political upheavals can hurt long-term performance and revenues,” Wayne Troughton told the conference. In the assessment other Portuguese-speaking countries such as Angola, Guinea Bissau or São Tomé and Príncipe were not even mentioned.</p>
<p>“We are following the investment of structured funds, predominantly from Europe and the Middle East, an increasing percentage of individuals with high liquidity from Europe, the Middle East and Africa itself, European, African and North American proprietary investors and family funds from the Middle East, the United Kingdom, Europe and South Africa,” said the head of HTI Consulting.</p>
<p>The most frequent investment opportunity, he said, are mid-range, 150-room city hotel located near business districts, conference centres and transportation platforms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ZIMBABWE Youth in Tourism patron, First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa, has called on African countries to synchronise their tourism, trade and investment policy frameworks to take full advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement.<span id="more-3096224744034359"></span></p>
<p>In a speech read on her behalf by acting Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Industry minister Nqobizitha Ndlovu at the Africa Youth in Tourism conference held in Bulawayo, Mnangagwa said: “There is need to synchronise African countries’ tourism, trade and investment policy frameworks to engineer enabling mechanism to take full advantage of the newly formed African continental free trade area.”</p>
<p>“This calls on Zimbabwe as a major actor in tourism to drive the south regional economic integration to make Africa an optimum destination for Africa. In the process, this will allow plenty of labour and unintended cross border trade of goods and services.”</p>
<p>To date, 27 countries, including Zimbabwe, have ratified AfCFTA meant to create strong economic integration on the continent by forming a single continental market.<br />
It is also one of the largest free trade areas since the formation of the World Trade Organisation, given Africa’s current population of 1,2 billion people, which is expected to grow to 2,5 billion by 2050.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="a1dbe">What is South African cuisine? Is it mielie pap? Boerewors? Milk tart?</p>
<p class="a1dbe">At his new fine dining restaurant, Les Créatifs, in Johannesburg’s Bryanston neighborhood, Chef Wandile Mabaso is gradually incorporating traditional ingredients in his menu. He develops experimental flavors using South African staples. Chakalaka, a spicy vegetable relish, is fermented in beetroot juice. Creamy risotto is made using a traditional starch, samp (dried corn kernels broken into chunks), instead of arborio rice.</p>
<p class="a1dbe">Mabaso believes most chefs apply the standard approach to South African food. They infuse a dish with rooibos tea or serve an ostrich steak. Yes, these ingredients were grown on South African soil, but it’s not part of our daily diet. He explains that there’s no history of South Africans eating kudu or ostrich as part of our food culture.</p>
<p class="a1dbe">“The top chefs we have in the country, the majority of them are not South African. The guys that are South African, they are very much out of touch with what the rest of South Africa grew up eating, or what they perceive as South African food,” says Mabaso.Until recently, European cuisine was considered the epitome of epicurean aspiration while indigenous foods were disparaged. A new generation of chefs is trying to bridge the gap between historically suppressed food culture and the modern interpretation of fine dining to determine and refine an authentic understanding of South African cuisine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4341" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/devv-e1568732721375.png" alt="" width="500" height="382" /></p>
<p class="a1dbe">It’s not just that black chefs have historically been excluded from the highest echelons of the profession; even today, previously disadvantaged chefs frequently lack the resources, not to mention cultural capital, to put indigenous South African cuisine and recipes front and centre of the fine dining experience.For Mabaso, South African food is not determined by a specific flavor or ingredient: “It doesn’t have to be something tangible, it can just be a concept. For example, I was driving in Soweto and I happened to see a group of guys playing dice in the corner which we grew up seeing all the time. I came back and literally created a dessert that’s a dice.”</p>
<p class="a1dbe">Mabaso creates a visual story on the plate. His desserts are rooted in a sense of memory and past experience. Humble ingredients, like <em>amasi</em> (fermented milk) and <em>amabele </em>(sorghum), are transformed into complex and refined dessert elements while preserving the nostalgia of childhood foods.While some chefs might simply fold sorghum into an ice cream mixture, Mabaso slowly develops flavor over a two-month fermentation process. Sorghum is fermented, cooked, then fermented again before it’s incorporated into a custard base. The resulting <em>amabele</em> ice cream has an intense depth of flavour developed over time.</p>
<p class="a1dbe">“As a chef, my job is to be an interpreter between nature and human beings. So I need to teach human beings how to eat, what to eat, how to transform certain foods,” says Mabaso. The notion of ‘refining’ or ‘transforming’ local foods doesn’t mean masking or manipulating the taste. It means enhancing the natural taste through refined cooking techniques and allowing the flavors to intensify.</p>
<p class="a1dbe">This idea is practiced at the Artivist where <em>skop</em> (sheep’s head) is served in a simple but elegant manner. Pulled sheep’s head is served without the skeleton, with a simple beetroot pickle and pap or steamed bread<em>. </em> “We value minimalism and subtlety in the dishes. It’s so rich, we don’t do much to it. You still want to taste the ingredients,” says The Artivist co-owner Bradley Williams.The Artivist is a modern urban bistro reclaiming cultural identity through a curated food experience. Their menu is a celebration of Pan-African street food, but heroes township delicacies like <em>mogodo</em> (tripe) and <em>skop</em>.</p>
<p class="a1dbe">“We bring township food into accessible areas,” says Williams. He explains that cheap cuts of meat such as tripe, gizzards and sheep’s head were considered “poor black food” and formed a barrier of cultural separation. The Artivist brings authentic township food to modern dining with a menu influenced by international flavors.The <em>mogodu</em>, jokingly referred to as ‘private school <em>mogodu</em>’, was inspired by Brazilian <em>feijoada. </em>The tripe is cooked with black beans, butter beans, chorizo and tomato to intensify the inherent umami flavour of <em>mogodu</em>.</p>
<p class="a1dbe">At an event hosted by iconic fashion brand Loxion Kulca, The Artivist served house <em>mogodu</em> on steamed bread in bite-sized tapas portions. Williams explains how the traditionally solo food is “remixed” to create canapés for a social occasion.When applying modern cooking techniques to traditional ingredients, chefs are cautious to preserve the integrity of the ingredient. Innovative chefs like Siyabulela Kobo manage to enhance ingredients without stripping their fundamental flavors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4342" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/devvv-e1568732784917.png" alt="" width="500" height="336" /></p>
<p class="a1dbe">Kobo grew up in the Eastern Cape and affirms that “our food is not about spices, it’s about purity of the ingredients.”He describes his cuisine as ‘progressive African-style food’: a balance of heritage flavors and modern techniques, embracing local, seasonal ingredients in their entirety. A signature dish, <em>umvubo</em>, reimagines <em>amasi</em> in sophisticated jellies and honey-<em>amasi</em> spheres. The spheres retain the tangy flavor and smooth texture of the traditional fermented drink.</p>
<p class="a1dbe">The dish is finished with a few delicate pap <em>tuiles</em> (wafers). Burnt phutu pap left at the bottom of the pot is salvaged, reboiled, blitzed in a food processor, and strained. The mixture is spread thin and baked in the oven to create crisp, arced wafers.So, what is South African food? According to these groundbreaking chefs and restaurateurs, its South African ingredients or experiences refined through complex cooking techniques while preserving their essence. It’s comfort food or township foods interpreted to suit modern restaurant dining. “I don’t think the country is ready for it yet,” says Chef Mabaso, “but this is how I want to end my career, to reinvent and refine South African cuisine.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the culinary world continues to be dominated by male chefs and restaurateurs, there are a number of female chefs and restaurateurs who are dishing up significant and inspiring moments in the food scene. Here are two women who have made a name for themselves in the SA culinary world.</p>
<p><strong>Nthabiseng Ramaboa</strong>, fondly known as chef Nti, is a celebrity chef, blogger, entrepreneur and apron designer.</p>
<p><strong>Briefly describe your earliest cooking memory?</strong></p>
<p>At home in Soweto helping mom prepare dinner for the family.</p>
<p><b>What was the motivation for becoming a chef?</b></p>
<p>For me becoming a chef was the next best thing when my other love – fashion business – didn’t work out. I tried the food. And thank goodness it’s working out.</p>
<p><b>Describe your journey as a female in professional kitchens?</b></p>
<p>The industry is predominantly male, women have very few chefs to look up to. Even in the professional kitchen – that space has always seen as “a man’s place”. One is constantly working to own the space and claim it as a place women belong.</p>
<p><b>What is your most treasured memory/experience of your career so far?</b></p>
<p>Working with an international giant, such as British Chef Marco Pierre White, and the three &#8216;Australian MasterChef&#8217; judges – Gary, Matt and George.</p>
<p><b>Do you have any advice for young women considering becoming professional chefs?</b></p>
<p>Your dreams are valid. Get ready to work hard, and let love for food guide you through your journey.</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>International supermodel, restaurateur and self-taught chef <strong>Mala Bryan</strong> is also the creator of malaville dolls</p>
<p><b>Briefly describe your earliest cooking memory?</b></p>
<p>My grandmother was a street food vendor and I was her assistant from when I was seven-years-old. I used to help her in the kitchen with prep work and also making sure everything was done properly. By nine-years-old, I was able to cook full meals on my own.</p>
<p><b>What have been some of the challenges and obstacles you’ve faced starting out in the restaurant business?</b></p>
<p>Starting out as a chef in South Africa and trying to introduce Caribbean cuisine was really a challenge. I had to think of ways to make the Caribbean food merge with local favourites. Finding certain foods have also been a bit tough and I’ve had to substitute many things and also blend many of my own seasonings, to come as close as we would get in the Caribbean.</p>
<p><b>What, to date, have been career highlights for you, particularly as a female chef?</b></p>
<p>The pleasure of cooking overseas, assisting Chef Giorgio Nava, of 95 Keerom and Carne restaurants, in places like South Korea and Italy. Also being at the same events with Italian restaurateur Massimo Bottura and him loving our food.</p>
<p><b>What advice would you give to young women looking to start in the culinary industry?</b></p>
<p>Do not feel intimidated by thinking it is a male dominated industry. If you really want to be in the culinary industry you have to be really be passionate about it and do it with love because it is not easy… the love for cooking and the industry will conquer that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Kenyan Chef, based in Mombasa on Sunday broke the world record in a cooking competition.</p>
<p>Chef Maliha Mohammed broke the Guinness World Record after emerging the longest cooking chef.</p>
<p>Maliha set a new record by cooking for 75hrs non-stop beating current 68hrs record. The current world record is held by Rickey Lumpkin from California, US who cooked for 68 hours 30 minutes and one second in December 2018.</p>
<p>Early in May, 2019 Maliha  began her quest to have her name immortalised in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
<p>Mohammed, a mother of two, conducted her first trial at Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) by cooking 100 recipes in 36-hour non-stop over the weekend.</p>
<p>In July, Mohammed began the second trial of 200 recipes for 54 hours before going for the final competition on August 12 which will be supervised by officials from the Guinness World Record.</p>
<p>With a support team of 40 individuals working in shifts of 10, Mohammed had previously expressed confidence that she was bringing the record home.</p>
<p>Her efforts to compete in 2018, she said, failed due to ‘’financial constraints’’.</p>
<p>The Guinness Book of World Records is a reference book published annually, listing world records both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world.</p>
