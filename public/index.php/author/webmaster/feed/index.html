				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Promperu and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in collaboration with the Basque Culinary Center, are organizing the 2nd UNWTO World Forum on Gastronomy Tourism, to take place from 27-29 April 2016 in Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>Gastronomy, as the essence of culture and a major element of intangible heritage worldwide is a growing driver for tourists that remains often untapped by destinations. The interrelation between gastronomy and tourism provide a vehicle for the transmission of culture which in turn, if properly managed, enhances local economic development, sustainable practices and food experiences. Hence, gastronomy tourism, helps to brand and market destinations, as well as assists in maintaining and preserving local tradition and diversity, harnessing and rewarding authenticity.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local prize winning chefs and bartenders have been challenged to use their skills, knowledge and passion to refashion the tastes of citizens to eat healthy using locally grown food. Tourism Development Company’s board chairman, Dennise Demming, who issued the challenge on February 22 in an address at the Trinidad Hotels, Restaurants and Tourism Association (THRTA) Culinary Competition awards ceremony at the Hyatt Regency said, “If you want to continue to make the CUTT (Culinary Competition of Trinidad and Tobago), you have to move our palettes to less sugar, less salt and a yearning for things local.” By doing so, she said, chefs and bartenders will also encourage people to eat healthy, reduce obesity in adults and children, and reduce spending in the health sector.</p>
