				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Over the past 100 years, ‘ulu and many of Hawai‘i’s other heritage crops have taken a back seat to imported, highly processed factory foods, which has had negative impacts on the local economy and community health. With revived interest in indigenous rights and local, national, and global food systems in recent decades, traditional Hawaiian crops are garnering attention and momentum. In 2016, the Hawai‘i ‘Ulu Producers Cooperative was formed to build a network of small-scale diversified farms on Hawai‘i Island that grow breadfruit and want to improve community access to this amazing, nutritious food. The Co-op has grown rapidly as demand for ‘ulu – or breadfruit –increases just as fast. This group of farmers are bringing ‘ulu back, with a vengeance.</span></em></p>
<p>By Michelle Curran</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Ulu (breadfruit) has a long history in Hawai’i, introduced approximately a thousand years ago by Polynesian seafarers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It played an important role in pre-contact food security and sustainability. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not only did ‘ulu become a staple in the Hawaiian peoples’ diet but the plant was used for numerous other purposes, including caulking for canoes, glue for bird traps, wood for surfboards, and sap for medicine.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Ulu grows well in a range of tropical and sub-tropical environments – in Hawai’i this includes most climates around the state between sea-level and nearly 2,000ft elevation – the crop flourishes there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is one of the world’s few staple crops which grow on perennial trees, so it does not need to be replanted every year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A single ‘ulu tree can live for 50 to 100 years or more and produce hundreds, even over a thousand, pounds of fruit annually, while also helping to sequester carbon and reduce the need to till soil or control weeds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The trees’ tolerance to heat and drought make them a favoured orchard crop in tropical communities most vulnerable to famine and climate change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the introduction of imported and highly processed foods, people have consumed less ‘ulu and other heritage crops, which over time, has affected the economy and the health of the people who live in the Hawaiian Islands. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People are realising the benefits of a traditional diet, which of course, includes the abundant ‘ulu. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2015, Dana Shapiro and her husband Noa Lincoln, a professor in indigenous crops, began </span><span class="s2">Mala Kalu&#8217;ulu</span><span class="s1">, a breadfruit farm, after winning Kamehameha Schools’ Mahi Ai Match-up contest.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4267" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="739" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op3.jpg 1000w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op3-300x222.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op3-768x568.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple received a 3.7 acre plot in south Kona, with five years’ rent waived, and $25,000 in seed money. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The land is situated in the Kona historic ‘ulu belt, once a half-mile wide and 18 miles long, and by some estimates, used to produce 36,000 tons of ‘ulu a year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After one year, Dana and Noa ran into a few obstacles – including the highly seasonal nature of ‘ulu.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Large quantities of the fruit usually come into maturity from July through October, resulting in a glut of the crop from late summer to fall and hardly any for the rest of the year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They could steam and freeze the fruit to stretch the season, but they still did not have the volume to supply a growing year-round demand. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dana began reaching out to others in the community, to see what other ‘ulu<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>supply was on Hawai’i Island, and met two other farmers who were in similar position &#8211; young families starting out and passionate about ‘ulu.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having previously consulted for rural producers and worked with different cooperatives around the state, Dana saw the potential and in July 2016, </span><span class="s2">Mala Kalu&#8217;ulu</span><span class="s1">, along with eight other pilot member farms from around Hawai’i Island, formed <a href="https://eatbreadfruit.com/"><span class="s3">Hawai’i ‘Ulu Producers Cooperative (HUPC).</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The now HUPC Manager Dana says the Co-op has since grown to include 80 members on both Hawai’i Island and Maui.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We founded the Co-op as we were all interested in working together to leverage our collective capabilities to create a commercial ‘ulu industry to enhance Hawaii&#8217;s food security today, as it did in the past not so long ago,” Dana says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We have a mission to revitalise ‘ulu as a viable crop and dietary staple for Hawai’i; while our vision is a thriving ‘ulu co-op that sustains and uplifts producers, consumers and society as a whole.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a co-op, the farmers own the business and elect a board of directors from the general membership each year. Dana has been hired to run the operations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We currently have about 10 employees who aggregate farmers&#8217; fruit, process, pack and market the co-op&#8217;s products as well as provide education for farmers and the community,” she explains. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was determined a co-op structure was the right business model for HUPC due to its primary goal of developing a sustainable ‘ulu industry in Hawai‘i that supports farmers and the community. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To do this, a large number of small, diversified ‘ulu producers working together to meet Hawai‘i’s demand for nutritious food (rather than a small number of large plantations) is required.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4268 size-full" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op4.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="751" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op4.jpg 501w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op4-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By coming together in a co-op, local producers are able to develop economies of scale, ensure year-round production, attain bargaining power, and leverage each other’s social, economic, political, and other resources to bring the project to fruition and benefit more of Hawai‘i’s communities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The benefits of belonging to the Co-op are ten-fold. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Farmers receive a premium price and guaranteed market for their produce; they can access technical assistance, ongoing training in sustainable production practices and customised guidance and support from leading researchers and agronomists in the field; and their marketing, sales, education, outreach, and administration is all taken care of for them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They share in the earnings of the business and have a single taxation advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Participating in the governance of a new, exciting, local farmer-owned and -operated venture while collaborating with other community groups to move Hawai‘i’s food system in the right direction is also a positive outcome of being part of the Co-op. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the beginning, Sweet Cane Cafe, a farm-to-table restaurant in Hilo, served as the sole receiving point and processor. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2017, the Co-op built its own processing facility in south Kona to handle a greater volume and provide an additional place farmers could drop off fruit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although HUPC offers fresh ‘ulu available in baby, mature and ripe stages, the already prepared and frozen fruit make up 75 percent of sales.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Ulu is pressure washed to remove the latex and debris, peeled with hand-cranked peelers, cut by hand, steamed and flash-frozen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most buyers prefer ‘ulu cored and quartered, though HUPC also offers it in other forms including sliced, diced, mashed and cut for fries. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Co-op has also developed a line of ‘ulu-based products, ‘Ulu Lā &#8211; the Age of ‘Ulu in Hawaiian.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Products include Traditional and ‘Inamona-Macnut Hummus and Chocolate Mousse – and they are made with locally-grown, farm-fresh ‘ulu, and are free of dairy, eggs, gluten, and GMOs, and are ready to eat straight out of recycled-content/recyclable packaging. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Co-op currently has approximately 150 unique customers throughout Hawai’i State. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Fifty percent of our market is taken by the Hawai’i Department of Education as we supply all public schools across the state,” Dana says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In addition, we work with five private and public hospitals while about half our customers are restaurants and hotels that incorporate ‘ulu onto their menus as a way to support local farmers and serve authentically Hawaiian crops to their customers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re committed to making ‘ulu as accessible as possible to the community &#8211; we don’t want ‘ulu to be a niche product only available for high-end hotels.” </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4270" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="658" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op2.jpg 1000w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op2-300x197.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ulu-co-op2-768x505.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From a nutritional perspective, ‘ulu is a complex carbohydrate with high amounts of dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals, particularly phosphorous, magnesium, vitamin A and beta-carotene. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has a relatively low glycaemic index making it good for pre-diabetics and those with other diet related diseases like obesity, and it is relatively high in protein for a fruit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Ulu is incredibly versatile from a culinary standpoint, so in addition to the health, environmental and local economic benefits it is truly a delicious and underutilised food. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It offers a healthier alternative to starches such as potatoes, wheat, and white rice, and can be used to make soups, salads, stews, casseroles, lasagne, burgers, hummus, pickles, gnocchi—even gluten-free flour and healthier versions of chips, breads, chocolate mousse, and ice cream. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We find many chefs enjoy expressing their culinary creativity and skills through this indigenous staple crop,” she adds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, the HUPC took part in the second annual Hawai’i Kuauli Pacific &amp; Asia Cultural Festival’s Taste of the Pacific and Asia event. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Staged in Kona, local chefs came together at the event to showcase their creations, made from locally-sourced foods. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chefs such as Muzzy Fernandez, the Executive Chef at Kona Coast’s Club Hokuli&#8217;a, says he sources the ‘ulu he uses in his cuisine from the Co-op as do most of the other chefs who cooked at the event. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Muzzy’s feature dish at the Taste event and one which he prepares at Club Hokuli&#8217;a was Pigs in da Blanket – pork in an ‘ulu crepe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although the Co-op has undergone rapid growth in the three years since it started and member farms continue to ramp up ‘ulu production, HUPC still relies on start-up grant funds and loans from community members and the Department of Agriculture to support its operations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dana estimates HUPC will achieve economies of scale when it is able to sell 100,000 pounds a year; currently, the main bottleneck is supply. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Among the 35 members, about 2,500 trees have been planted, but only 400 are mature. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, with the 2018 volcanic eruption on Hawai’i Island, member farms in Puna were covered by lava, and HUPC lost about 20 percent of production – a setback for the industry as a whole, but not unexpected in agricultural sector susceptible to natural and climatic events.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dana says in five years, the Co-op hopes to be self-sustaining. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It projects having over one million pounds of ‘ulu per year based on members’ existing plantings, so helping to drive market demand for this large volume will be a big part of the Co-op’s work over the next few years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I can see this coming from both further value added product development as well as public education and promotion around the benefits of ‘ulu and all the wonderful dishes that can be made from it.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having already provided the Hawaiian people with so much, it is encouraging to see one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly foods on the planet making its comeback, thanks to a group of committed farmers, with a passion for all things ‘ulu.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>On the island of Nevis, it literally rains mangoes in the summertime. The abundant stone fruit has melted into the cuisines, cultures and hearts of the people who live on the idyllic Caribbean sister island to St Kitts. Six years ago, in an attempt to boost tourism in the slow summer months, Nevis Tourism Authority began the Nevis Mango and Food Festival to capitalise on mango season, while supporting the agriculture sector&#8217;s effort to establish a viable mango industry for Nevis, where just one road circles the whole island and it takes an easy 45-minute drive to circumnavigate. The Festival is also an opportunity for Nevisian Chefs to come together, working alongside growers, to showcase the versatile mango which is more than just a delicious stone fruit to the island residents. It could also be a livelihood.</em></p>
<p>By Michelle Curran</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mangoes are something of a national pastime throughout the Caribbean, with each village claiming they grow the best mangoes.</p>
<p>It is a hotly-contested rivalry.</p>
<p>On the island of Nevis, mangoes are very much part of the islanders’ lives, offering nourishment, and potentially a form of income as the agricultural sector strives to establish a mango industry for Nevis.</p>
<p>Over 500 varieties of mangoes can be found growing worldwide, while there are officially 44 different kinds of mangoes in Nevis; the Amory Polly, Julie and Long mangoes are just a few of the most prized.</p>
<p>At the peak of the sugar industry in the 18th-century, Nevis was known as the Queen of the Caribbean, for the island&#8217;s beauty and social grace of its planter and merchant families.</p>
<p>Since the last sugar mills shut down in the 1930s, the former British colony has come to depend pretty much solely on tourism and it has taken a careful approach to development – steering clear from mass tourism, cruise ships and busy resorts.</p>
<p>The establishment of the <a href="https://nevismangofest.com/">Nevis Mango and Food Festival</a> six years ago was a way of not only increasing tourist numbers in the slower summer months; but to capitalise on mango season – which typically runs from June until September – bringing together chefs, foodies, the hospitality sector, and growers to enjoy everything the mango has to offer.</p>
<p>Founder of the Festival Nevis Tourism Authority continues to run and host the weekend-long event from July 4-7, totally dedicated to the mango and the deliciously creative cuisine made with it.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer for the Tourism Authority Greg Phillip says the Festival came about due to the abundance of varieties of mangoes as well as the amazing food scene already established in Nevis.</p>
<p>“We also needed an innovative event to attract summer visitors so we combined these two features of Nevis to create what has become one of the world’s most creative food festivals,” Greg says.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4199 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Local-chefs-showcase-their-mango-inspired-creations-at-the-Nevisian-Chefs-Mango-Feast.-CREDIT-Supplied.-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Local-chefs-showcase-their-mango-inspired-creations-at-the-Nevisian-Chefs-Mango-Feast.-CREDIT-Supplied.-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Local-chefs-showcase-their-mango-inspired-creations-at-the-Nevisian-Chefs-Mango-Feast.-CREDIT-Supplied.-300x200.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Local-chefs-showcase-their-mango-inspired-creations-at-the-Nevisian-Chefs-Mango-Feast.-CREDIT-Supplied.-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><em>Local chefs showcase their mango-inspired creations at the Nevisian Chefs Mango Feast. CREDIT Supplied.</em></p>
<p>The Festival targets food-loving travellers and tourists, who are seeking a memorable vacation experience of a lifetime, he adds.</p>
<p>“When we were setting up the Festival, the main purpose of it was to attract summer visitors to Nevis; but now it also aims to support the agriculture sector&#8217;s effort to establish a viable mango industry for Nevis.”</p>
<p>While Nevis cannot export fresh mangoes due to quarantine restrictions, there are goals to develop an industry where the frozen pulp can be exported.</p>
<p>With mangoes in abundance throughout the Caribbean and of course, on the island of Nevis, which covers a meagre 36 miles, Greg adds he has seen a definite resurgence in chefs and eateries around the island using local products.</p>
<p>“Food made with the freshest high quality ingredients simply tastes better.”</p>
<p>There are no fast-food restaurants on Nevis, and restaurants there range from rustic beach bars and authentic village eateries, to refined places for more formal dining.</p>
<p>Nevis is known throughout the Caribbean for its excellent culinary scenes, and this is mostly due to its local chefs.</p>
<p>The best local culinary talent is on display at the Nevisian Chef’s Mango Feast event, a feature event of the Festival.</p>
<p>These chefs come from top-rated restaurants on Nevis, and face the same creative culinary challenge to incorporate Nevis mangoes in all they cook.</p>
<p>Local culinary students are also chosen as interns to work along with the professional chefs, to present them an extraordinary opportunity to gain valuable experience, and to help them earn a scholarship to help them to complete their studies.</p>
<p>Greg says the Nevisian Chefs Mango Feast is indeed the highlight of the Festival.</p>
<p>“This is the final event and it involves native Nevisian chefs who create their best mango dishes and provide them as free samples to the patrons – locally-based restaurants also do the same.</p>
<p>“There is also a mango cooking competition with chefs from across the Caribbean and live music, which all takes place on July 7, while the mango tasting event and village food tour which happens the day before are also highlights,” he adds.</p>
<p>The Cooking Mango Masterclass with a local chef offers the opportunity to participate in a practical cooking session with an expert on cooking with mangos; while the various dinners over the weekend provides a chance to sample mango-inspired dishes, as well as network with chefs and guests.</p>
<p>Returning to take part in the Nevisian Chefs Mango Feast is Chef Llewellyn Clarke, a butcher at the Four Seasons Resort Nevis, and co-owner of Llewellyn’s Agro Processing Factory.</p>
<p>The chef of thirty years is renowned for his pepper sauces, made on Nevis but enjoyed worldwide.</p>
<p>Born in Manchester, England, Llewellyn says he distinctly remembers his first cooking experience of making fresh bread and Nevisian coconut tart with his mother.</p>
<p>“This ignited my journey to becoming a chef and working in some of the best restaurants in London and Canada, including Le Caprice, The Ivy and Auberge du Pommier.</p>
<p>“It was this skill of producing high quality food with top quality produce that I took with me when I immigrated to Nevis in 1999.”</p>
<p>In that time, he has produced gourmet hot pepper sauces in a variety of flavours, such as thyme, papaya and guava.</p>
<p>“My freshly made local ice creams include mango, soursop, coffee and Jack Daniels for the drinkers.</p>
<p>“Our Jams and chutneys are renown for locking in the flavour of the Caribbean, while the milled products such as breadfruit flour is a winner with the health conscious and those on gluten free diets,” Llewellyn adds.</p>
<p>The chef’s signature products however are hot pepper and thyme sauce closely followed by mango and hot pepper sauce, he has developed over the years.</p>
<p>These products are enjoyed locally and have become essential souvenir items for many tourists – the sauces are served daily at Four Seasons Resort and Sunshine’s Bar and Grill on Nevis, while also sold at local supermarkets.</p>
<p>Llewellyn says the reason why he takes part in the Nevis Mango and Food Festival and the Mango Feast is to show how the mango can be incorporated into many dishes &#8211; from starters, main courses to desserts, and to showcase mango-based creations.</p>
<p>For this year’s Mango feast, Llewellyn is preparing a dish called Mango Chicken Fiesta, which he describes as a colourful mango chicken dish, with peppers and onions.</p>

<p>“I really cannot wait to watch the Festival unfold with all the chefs in full-swing, showing the talent Nevisian chefs have to offer.”</p>
<p>The chef says it is important to use locally-produced foods and he encourages other chefs and those in the tourism and hospitality industries to do so also.</p>
<p>“I typically use local foods from Nevis in my cuisine – in ice creams made from local fruits, salad dressings, regular pepper sauce and fruit-flavoured pepper sauces too.</p>
<p>“Using local produce helps the farmers and the market vendors’ pockets – and ultimately the money stays in the country.</p>
<p>“This encourages farmers to plant, thus creating work for others.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the demand for locally-produced foods is growing, with many people being turned off imported foods which have been exposed to chemical assistance to make them look good, he says.</p>
<p>“A lot of the food grown and produced on Nevis is free from chemicals and can definitely be called organic.</p>
<p>“The health-conscious are now enquiring more about the food we consume; how it is prepared; and checking the ingredient list.”</p>
<p>Other Nevisian locals joining Llewellyn in the Mango Feast include Chef Michael Henville, a Nevis school meals programme chef; Chef Wilroy Webbe, who trained in the craft of cooking authentic Nevisian cuisine and works at Wilma’s Diner in Charlestown, Nevis; and Chef Renaldo Mills, a professional chef with the burning aspiration to become an executive chef at a Five Star luxury hotel.</p>
<p>Nevisian Chef Iyana I. Dore has participated in the Nevis Mango and Food Festival for five years and will return in 2019.</p>
<p>Each year she bakes – even though asked to cook – resulting in delicious mango-inspired creations.</p>
<p>Chef Aalyah VJ Caines – a chef at the Park Hyatt, St. Kitts &#8211; speaks of food with a certain passion which reminds you of an artist speaking about her latest work.</p>
<p>She will be joined at the Mango Feast, with a fellow culinary artist, Chef Berecia Stapleton, who creates food from unlikely paired ingredients.</p>
<p>This year, the Nevis Mango and Food Festival will also see international celebrity chefs taking part in, and hosting multiple events over the weekend.</p>
<p>Headlining the Festival is Food Network affiliated Chef Judy Joo, who is Korean-American French-trained and based in London.</p>
<p>Judy has been an Iron Chef with the Food Network in the United Kingdom and has appeared as a judge on shows on the United States Food Network.</p>
<p>She will take part in the cooking demonstrations, oversee the cooking competitions among other Nevisian chefs, and whip up some of the most flavourful mango dishes to be had anywhere.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Chef Judy Joo’s Mango Lime Ricotta Parfaits</h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br />
1½ ripe mangos, peeled, pitted, and cut into 2cm pieces, plus some sliced for garnish<br />
½ lime, juiced<br />
1 cup (135g) granola<br />
2 cups ricotta (500 grams)<br />
4 tsp honey, plus more for drizzling<br />
zest of 2 limes</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong><br />
In a small bowl, toss the mango in the lime juice to coat.<br />
In juice glasses, create layers, by spooning in carefully some mango, then top with a layer of granola, some ricotta, then some honey. Repeat.<br />
Garnish with fresh mango slices on top, a drizzle of honey, and curly lime zest.</p>
<p>Fellow international chef cooking alongside Judy will be Chef Simon Jenkins.</p>
<p>Simon has to date worked with some of the most highly regarded chefs at Michelin star level; he now runs his own successful consultancy / advisory business, in the UK and internationally.</p>
<p>For Nevisians, mango season means eating mangoes – and not much else –all day, and now of course, it means the Nevis Mango and Food Festival.</p>
<p>Mango is a comfort food, which nourishes both the body and soul.</p>
<p>Its popularity can be felt in every aspect of local life and culture in Nevis – and its motif used in textiles, paintings, jewellery and as an everlasting sign of desire and plenty.</p>
<p>With such abundance, there is definitely scope for an industry of sorts, allowing the mango to also positively impact Nevisian’s socio-economic status.</p>
<p>The Nevis Mango and Food Festival is an incredible opportunity to feature this Nevisian staple; promote awareness around it; and create far-reaching demand for Nevisian mangoes – providing income for growers, and delicious produce for chefs and the tourism/hospitality industry to utilise.</p>
<p>It is also a chance to taste some of the best food in the Caribbean, where the humble mango is the star – and offers so much more than just a tasty treat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For nearly three decades, grassroots organisation Slow Foods has worked around the globe in over 160 countries to</em><em> </em><em>prevent the disappearance of local food cultures and traditions and counteract the rise of a fast life.</em></p>
<p><em>It strives to combat people’s dwindling interest in the food they eat</em><em>; where it comes from; and how our food choices affect the world around us. </em></p>
<p><em>Slow Farms – a Slow Foods initiative, aims to revive, protect and strengthen traditional small and indigenous farms, as bastions of food security and sovereignty for the people of the Americas.</em></p>

<p>Meet Néstor Mendieta, a Slow Food activist in Colombia and leader of the movement in Bucaramanga.</p>
<p>Agriculture is a challenging sector to be a part of in Colombia, Nestor says.</p>
<p>In rural areas, poverty is high as is illiteracy, and many producers say they have no machinery or farming infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The difficulties faced by farmers have led to the land surface area for permanent crops being increased, while temporary crops, such as maize, soya, potatoes, rice and vegetables, have not grown much,” Néstor says.</p>
<p>“As a result, Colombia imports 28 percent of the food it consumes.</p>
<p>“Clearly, the young workforce is abandoning the countryside, because they do not see future opportunities there.”</p>
<p>Although armed conflict has mostly ended in Colombia, during 2018 and 2019 more than 200 community leaders were murdered – remnants of violence remain, Néstor adds.</p>
<p>In a large proportion of cases, the murders appear to be associated with two phenomena.</p>
<p>Land restitution, which is part of the reparation process for the victims of armed conflict, is one of these phenomena; as are the actions by environmentalist leaders who try to prevent mining and energy production.</p>
<p>These activities present serious threats to the Colombian countryside.</p>
<p>La finca veleña se defiende de la minería (Vélez farms fight back against mining) is an initiative that originated in the municipality of Vélez.</p>
<p>It has emerged as an alternative to the threat of mining the region has been facing for more than five years.</p>
<p>The initiative is based on a model, agreed upon by farmers in Vélez, which sets out the necessary qualities for farms to be sustainable, both in environmental terms, and in economic and social terms.</p>
<p>“Finca Veleña project was the inspiration to promote agreements between farmers in several municipalities in the Magdalena Medio region, Néstor explains.</p>
<p>“However, it was clear threats like mining or the production of agrofuels (biofuel produced by agricultural means) are supported by very powerful economic forces.</p>
<p>“We need to confront them with a great social force that can counter powers clearly greater than those of local government.”</p>
<p>Partnering with various organisations, Néstor’s team has have been working for more than 15 years to strengthen small-scale farms in this region of Colombia.</p>
<p>“We eventually decided to promote the initiative, 10,000 sustainable farms for Latin America.</p>
<p>“This initiative evolved, and soon became about the need to safeguard traditional food systems – it involved farmers but also people living in cities who understood the need to protect small scale farms and to benefit everyone.”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4155 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087913-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087913-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087913-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087913-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In Colombia, farmers and social leaders promote the initiative in each municipality, bringing together its residents so they can create the sustainable farm model for their area and start promoting it with their own local resources.</p>
<p>“It is important to involve farmers and emphasise sustainability starts with establishing agreements at grass-roots level,” Néstor says.</p>
<p>In 2018, Néstor attended Slow Food’s Terra Madre 2018 to share about the initiative, and how it is benefiting Colombia.</p>
<p>“At the same time, our Slow Food Cuba colleagues were promoting their Slow Fincas initiative – a network of Slow Farms in order to support and promote small, diversified agroecological farming throughout the island.”</p>
<p>From the two proposals, the creation of a Slow Farms programme for Latin America and the Caribbean was given the green light.</p>
<p>Traditionally small-scale “peasant” farms have been the basis of food systems throughout the Americas, producing indigenous foods while using environmentally friendly practices.</p>
<p>“Peasant farms – or <em>milpas</em>, <em>shagras</em>, <em>chacras</em> or <em>parcelas</em> are the backbone of the security and food sovereignty of our countries.”</p>
<p>The main threat to farmers in the Caribbean, like Colombia, is land-grabbing, with the purpose of allocating it to mining, the production of agrofuels or extensive cattle ranching.</p>
<p>“The penetration of transgenic seeds and the prohibition of the circulation of native seeds also threaten traditional peasant production and compromise biodiversity and the sustainability of our food systems.</p>
<p>“In fact, in many countries, such as Colombia, environmental and social leaders who oppose these purposes are being systematically threatened and killed.”</p>
<p>So how can Slow Farms benefit farmers and the wider population of the Caribbean?</p>
<p>Néstor says the main objective of Slow Farms is to demonstrate and emphasise how vital peasant farms in Latin America and the Caribbean are for the food sustainability, in the region, and throughout the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It is hoped governments, social organisations and citizens recognise the value of the small farms, and how they contribute to the economy and the wellbeing of society.</p>
<p>Long term, Néstor expects people to realise this value, and communities to commit to strengthening small farms through government actions and investments.</p>
<p>The biodiversity production is the main characteristic of the peasant farm, and this improves the diversity of the food supply in each location, he adds.</p>
<p>“Slow Farms facilitates the recovery of seeds and traditional crops, many of them exclusive of each territory.”</p>
<p>Demand for traditional crops and indigenous foods needs to be high for these small farms to flourish.</p>
<p>To create this demand, Slow Farms requires an alliance with the gastronomic and catering sector, which promotes and favours the use of diverse and traditional foods, Néstor explains.</p>
<p>Fortunately, chefs and hotels throughout the Caribbean are seeing the benefit of using indigenous foods at their establishments.</p>
<p>More often than not, tourists around the world are beginning to want a more authentic experience when they visit a destination.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4156 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087914-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087914-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087914-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SF0087914-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>By eating and drinking food and beverages which are indigenous, local and fresh, tourists can share in a place’s culture; and by working together, farmers, hotels, chefs and other tourist operators can promote this gastronomical and cultural experience.</p>
<p>“When traditional or ancestral foods stop being consumed they also stop being commercialised and produced,” Néstor says.</p>
<p>“The standardisation of diets throughout the world reduces the variety of food and contributes to the development of monocultures with serious environmental consequences.”</p>
<p>However, if we move in the opposite direction, the recovery of traditional peasant farms and local diets are a fundamental strategy for food sustainability on our planet, he adds.</p>
<p>In countries where Slow Foods is active, chefs have the opportunity to be part of the <a href="https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/what-we-do/slow-food-chefs-alliance/">Slow Food Chefs’ Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>The Alliance project started in Italy in 2009, and has since spread to various countries including Cuba and Colombia.</p>
<p>As Slow Farms takes off in the Caribbean, it is anticipated local chefs there will take the opportunity to be part of the Alliance.</p>
<p>Participating Alliance chefs all have very diverse backgrounds and cooking styles, but they all share a commitment to protecting agricultural biodiversity and to safeguarding gastronomic knowledge and local cultures.</p>
<p>These chefs cook in a huge range of different kitchens: in restaurants, inns and B&amp;Bs, or more informal places like markets and street food stands.</p>
<p>Slow Food Chef’s Alliance welcomes chefs with all kinds of cooking styles, whether ethnic, fusion or creative.</p>
<p>What is important is they always source quality ingredients (local, sustainable and seasonal); they can communicate the origin of their products; and they know the producers who supply them.</p>
<p>The Slow Food Chefs’ Alliance project cannot exist without quality ingredients.</p>
<p>Chefs must commit to using as many good, clean and fair foods as possible, products which could be linked to Slow Food projects (such as Slow Farms, the Presidia, the Ark of Taste, food communities or Earth Markets) or come from virtuous producers who respect the environment and animal welfare.</p>
<p>In particular, the chefs must include at least three Presidia products on their menus, prioritising local products and specifying on the menu the name of the producer, in order to highlight their work and give it visibility.</p>
<p>The Presidia and Ark products are marked with the project logos.</p>
<p>If the country has no Presidia, then there must be a recognised network of food communities or local producers with whom the chef regularly collaborates.</p>
<p>The Alliance chefs travel, meet with one another, participate in events and cook together.</p>
<p>When introducing the Slow Farms initiative to a new location, such as the Caribbean, Slow Farms has a protocol based on philosophical and operative principles, which allows people to identify with its cause.</p>
<p>It also has guidelines, around which people can develop the initiative in their territory.</p>
<p>Once these principles and guidelines are agreed upon, each country is free to implement the initiative how they see fit, while setting its own regulations and operating schemes.</p>
<p>Each country has a committee to communicate with the Slow Food advisors in Latin America and the Caribbean in order to facilitate the functioning of the network and the exchanges between the different locations, Néstor says.</p>
<p>There is hope governments will see the importance of Slow Farms; that Alliance chefs will start working with the small farm producers, to rejuvenate indigenous, local, sustainable foods.</p>
<p>The backbone of the community – farmers and producers – will be empowered, and traditional culture and ways of life will not be lost.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The best ideas are dreamed up when doing what you love. </em><em>As Hawaii’s Bryan Fujikawa sat on his boat fishing, rocking quietly, the idea for Sun Dried Specialties was born. The fisherman –turned chef opened a small family business producing and selling local delicacies 19 years ago, which has evolved into the Kona Grill House &#8211; a culinary destination for local cuisine which people return to from all over. Chef Bryan is one of nine Hawaii and Asia-based Chefs who showcase their local cuisine at the second annual Hawai’i Kuauli Pacific and Asia Cultural Festival, at Kailua-Kona on May 17-19. These chefs, who work in various restaurants and hotels in the tourist mecca of Hawaii, are passionate about using locally produced, sustainable and traditional food, and promoting this unique cuisine to the many tourists who venture on their shores all-year round.  </em></p>
<p>By Michelle Curran</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kealakekua on Hawai’i Island is famous for several things – Kealakekua Bay is where Captain James Cook perished and took his last breath; and it is where you will Kona Grill House &#8211; a hole-in-the-wall spot, where Chef Bryan Fujikawa creates his magic using all local products.</p>
<p>Back in 2000, Bryan made his living as a fisherman, but fate had other things in mind for the Kealakekua local.</p>
<p>One night, while out fishing, Bryan found he was being called to start his own business, after realising the dried fish he had grown up eating was disappearing from around the island.</p>
<p>He established Sun-Dried Specialties and together with his wife Rebecca and their two daughters, Bryan began drying the fish he caught from local waters, staying true to the old way of drying, using only fresh fish, Hawaiian salt, and sunshine.</p>
<p>The Sun-Dried Specialties logo of a sunbathing ahi quickly became recognisable for the best dried ahi, aku, and opelu in the state and eventually on the Mainland.</p>
<p>Twelve years later, Bryan opened Fishbowl &#8211; a small poke shop which has continued to grow over the years; and stocks more than a dozen different types of poke made fresh every day, as well as desserts Bryan’s daughter makes.</p>
<p>“I grew up eating and preparing Hawaiian cuisine my whole life…I always had a passion for creating and adding a twist to local food,” Bryan says.</p>
<p>His friends and family inspired him to become a chef and open his own place, he adds.</p>
<p>“I wanted a place we could all come and gather, talk stories, keep in touch and share our love of food &#8211; a place we could come together every night after a busy day at work.”</p>
<p>His small poke shop has evolved into Kona Grill House, and what started 19 years ago as a small family operation producing and selling dried fish has grown into a culinary destination for local cuisine that has people from not just Hawaii, but all over, returning time and time again.</p>

CREDIT Ewalina Photography</em></p>
<p>The food off the grill is “unforgettable” and Bryan’s customers like to say it is “five-star food out of a cardboard box”.</p>
<p>Bryan specialty lobster crab cakes are famous in these parts, as are his fish burgers, plus daily specials ranging from smoked prime rib to lobster mac and cheese.</p>
<p>Hawaiian cuisine is unique because it incorporates distinct styles of food from all over the world, Bryan says.</p>
<p>“Immigrants came together to share their style of food, from the Chinese to the Hawaiians, Filipinos, Portuguese.</p>
<p>“Hawaiian cuisine is so special because it showcases a history of different cultures combining parts of their culture in one dish.”</p>
<p>Using local produce in his dishes is the only way to go, and he only buys from local farmers, he says.</p>
<p>“I take pride in only using fresh island produce from local farmers, I believe in supporting local.”</p>
<p>Bryan buys his greens from the Honaunau-based Waiea Aquaponics, where the produce is well-taken care of, and he is never disappointed with anything he gets there.</p>
<p>He uses fish caught by local fishermen, and gets his meat from Wall Ranch in Kealakekua, who will hand-deliver anything he needs, when he needs it.</p>
<p>“We are all good friends,” he says.</p>
<p>Local produce is easy to come by if people are willing to take the time to do their research, and this helps to sustain local farming and fishing businesses.</p>
<p>There are also so many benefits of using local products, he adds.</p>
<p>“I would rather use produce from the Island over anywhere else, because I know where it comes from, and who is taking care of it.”</p>
<p>People are seeing these positives and choosing local more often, including the numerous tourists washing up on Hawaiian shores each year.</p>
<p>Bryan says he has had a lot of great experiences with tourists who visit his grill, and he keeps in touch with many of them.</p>
<p>Those who return annually let him know when they will be in town and can call in for some delicious food.</p>
<p>Serving high quality food with island flair while supporting other local businesses, in a place where everyone can come together to “talk story” and make life-long memories is what makes Bryan’s journey over the past two decades worthwhile.</p>
<p>He was delighted to be able to showcase some of his signature dishes at the</p>
<p>Hawai’i Kuauli Pacific and Asia Cultural Festival in Kailua-Kona, from May 17-19.</p>
<p>Bryan joined eight other chefs in the <a href="https://www.hikuauli.com/taste">Taste of Pacific and Asia</a> event at the festival, where they all created their signature dishes and the audience selected their favourite.</p>
<p>“Events like this are important to show Kona does have talented chefs who are creative and make food that people from all over the world love.</p>
<p>“These events are also great opportunities to introduce our island flavours to those unfamiliar with them.”</p>
<p>At the Taste event, Bryan whipped up Lobster Crab Cakes topped with Spicy Aioli Sauce; along with Teriyaki Furikake Salmon Poke; and his personal favourite Fresh Lomi Salmon Poke.</p>

<p>Other chefs involved involved the event included Executive Chef at Courtyard by Marriott &#8211; King Kamehameha&#8217;s Kona Beach Hotel Roy Basillo; Executive Chef at Club Hokuli&#8217;a Muzzy Fernandez; Executive Chef at Royal Kona Resort George Gomes; and Angela Kenyon, the Executive Sous Chef at Kukio.</p>
<p class="p1">Chef Roy was born and raised in Waialua, a small sugar plantation town on the North Shore of Oahu; and it was in this multi-culturally diverse community he experienced the varied cuisines of Japanese, Hawaiian, Portuguese, Korean, Spanish, Chinese and his own Filipino heritage.</p>
<p class="p1">“Even from a young age, although I did not realise it at the time, I was so into flavours and textures and wondering how food can taste so good prepared in so many different ways,” Chef Roy says.</p>
<p class="p1">​“In those times, food was grown in back yard gardens, we raised pigs, cows and chickens, and we fished for the oceans bounty &#8211; everything was fresh, clean and natural.”</p>
<p class="p1">Likewise, Chef Muzzy was raised on Oahu and gained a degree from the University of Hawaii West Campus in Culinary Arts. He has worked at Hualalai Four Seasons for 10 years under Chef James Ebreo and Chef Alan Wong.</p>
<p class="p1">He opened Jackie Rey&#8217;s Ohana Grill as Executive Chef for 10 years and employed at Kohanaiki Club for six years.</p>
<p class="p1">Currently, he is the Executive Chef at Club Hokuli&#8217;a using Hawaiian products, influenced by the many cultures in the melting pot of Hawai’i.</p>
<p class="p1">Another Hawai’i Island local, Chef George has over three decades of culinary experience with chef positions among top Big Island culinary locales, including Courtyard Marriott King Kamehameha Kona Beach Hotel and Mauna Kea Beach Hotel and Hapuna Prince Hotel, among many others throughout Hawai’i.</p>
<p class="p1">Chef Angela originally comes from the Adirondack Mountains in Upstate New York where both sides of her family have been producing maple syrup for generations.</p>
<p class="p1">Angela has lived on Hawai&#8217;i Island for the past 15 years, after transferring there from Italy, with the Four Seasons.</p>
<p class="p1">She has worked all over the world, but has worked at Kukio for almost five years.</p>
<p class="p1">Chef Angela has been heavily involved in the Kona Coffee Festival Recipe Contest for the last ten years and has won first place several times.</p>
<p class="p1">Japan’s Chef Kazuhiro Kimura and President of Connect to Life which provides wide ranges of food services such as; catering, food consulting, marketing, menu development, and cooking classes journeyed to Hawai’i to be part of the Festival; as did Chef Hong Eun Chun from Korea.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4137 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pic-1024x529.png" alt="" width="1024" height="529" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pic-1024x529.png 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pic-300x155.png 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pic-768x396.png 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pic.png 1356w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><em>(Left) Chefs cooked up their favourites at the Taste of Pacific and Asia.

<p class="p1">Ulu (breadfruit) is in abundance throughout Hawai’i, and the Hawai’i Ulu Co-op (HUC) also had a presence at the Taste of Pacific and Asia.</p>
<p class="p1">Farmer-owned and operated, HUC was founded in 2016 to revitalise breadfruit as a viable crop and dietary staple for Hawai‘i.</p>
<p class="p1">The Co-op has since grown from nine to over 70 farmer-members on both Hawai’i Island and Maui.</p>
<p class="p1">Its main operations include aggregating, minimally processing and marketing ‘ulu &#8211; primarily for food service operations such as school and hospitals statewide, as well as for myriad restaurants, caterers and grocery stores.</p>
<p class="p1">The co-op also produces several ready-to-eat products including two flavours of ‘ulu hummus and a dairy-free ‘ulu chocolate mousse.</p>
<p class="p1">This summer it plans to launch a retail pack of steamed-frozen ‘ulu so consumers may enjoy greater year-round access to this sustainable, nutritious, local starch.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to producing ‘ulu food products, the co-op continuously works to develop and deliver educational opportunities for producers and consumers.</p>
<p class="p1">For Chef Bryan, the highlight of being involved in the Taste event was seeing the younger generation of Kona come and experience unique Pacific and Asian cuisine.</p>
<p class="p1">“It is awesome to see the kids experience something like this at such a young age.</p>
<p class="p1">“It would be great to be able to inspire some of the younger generation to become chefs and make it their career.”</p>
<p class="p1">Now the festival is over, Chef Bryan will focus on building his business, he says.</p>
<p class="p1">“Right now, I’m excited to see where Kona Grill House is going.</p>
<p class="p1">“I am aiming for more pop-ups on the Mainland, and potentially getting my name out there, in Japan.”</p>
<p class="p1">He adds he is extremely blessed and excited for the future – one which includes the abundance of fresh, delicious and unique foods from Hawai’i Island.</p>
<p class="p1">With so much fresh food at their finger-tips, it is only natural for Hawaiian chefs, like Chef Bryan and everyone involved in the Taste of Pacific and Asia event to make use of this abundant supply in their cuisine, and to showcase the traditional and divine flavours of this Pacific paradise.</p>
<p class="p1">Tourists are embracing the unique foods, wanting to try more and sidestepping burgers and fries.</p>
<p class="p1">Hawai’i Island is setting an example, with chefs using sustainable, local and indigenous products to create amazing cuisine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A group of Food Warriors have set out to show the world how eating indigenous foods has a dramatic effect on the health of their respective country’s people. </em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Spearheaded by Kiwi Chef Robert Oliver, the Pacific Islands Food Revolution is an initiative to tackle the health crisis taking place in the Pacific currently. </em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>His passionate co-hosts and team are bringing about food awareness and encourage positive eating behaviours and the use of indigenous cuisine, while addressing the high rates of non-communicable diseases in the region through edutainment – and it is working…</em></p>
<p>By Michelle Curran</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer to the many issues affecting the Pacific lies within the region, particularly when it comes to health and well-being.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pacificislandfoodrevolution.com/">Pacific Island Food Revolution (PIFR)</a>, developed by Kiwi Chef Robert Oliver and jointly funded by the New Zealand and Australian government, sets out to prove this.</p>
<p>The world-renowned Chef heads the health education initiative tailored to audiences in the Pacific and is headlined by a &#8220;Masterchef-style&#8221; reality TV cooking competition, featuring contestants from Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu.</p>
<p>This series is supported by digital campaigns such as an online academy, digital storytelling and social media activities to bring about food awareness and encourage positive eating behaviours, while tackling high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) throughout the Pacific.</p>
<p>Robert says the South Pacific is experiencing a serious crisis.</p>
<p>“Non-communicable diseases are decimating Pacific Island populations due to poor food choices encouraged by massive marketing campaigns of fast foods,” he says.</p>
<p>“These foods &#8211; sugary drinks, instant noodles and more are replacing the traditional diet of the South Pacific, causing devastating levels of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and heartbreak.</p>
<p>“Where once Pacific populations used healthy, traditional foods to create their diet, a mindset of overseas food being better has all but eliminated them from today’s diets.”</p>
<p>Robert was raised in Fiji and Samoa, and he holds the Pacific region close to his heart.</p>
<p>After developing restaurants in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Sydney, farm to table resorts in the Caribbean and food programmes feeding homeless people and African immigrants with AIDS in New York City, Robert returned to the South Pacific to write his first book <a href="http://www.randomhouse.co.nz/books/robert-oliver/mea-kai-the-food-and-flavours-of-the-south-pacific-9781869621759.aspx">Me’a Kai</a>: The Food and Flavours of the South Pacific, written with a mission to connect Pacific agriculture to the region’s tourism.</p>

<p>Me’a Kai stunned the food world by winning top prize &#8211; Best Cookbook in the World 2010 &#8211; at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards in Paris, considered to be the Pulitzers of cookbooks, beating the books from NOMA and The New York Times.</p>
<p>In 2013, Robert released <a href="http://www.randomhouse.co.nz/books/robert-oliver/mea-ai-samoa-recipes-and-stories-from-the-heart-of-samoa-9781775534273.aspx">Mea’ai Samoa</a>: Recipes and Stories from the Heart of Polynesia and in May 2014, this book won the Best TV Chef Cookbook in the World 2013 at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards in Beijing.</p>
<p>Robert is also Chef Ambassador for Le Cordon Bleu, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, and is the presenter of <a href="http://realpasifik.com/">REAL PASIFIK</a>, a television series based on the food culture of the South Pacific.</p>
<p>For Robert, the answer to the crisis situation in the South Pacific has always been in the region, with the deep food knowledge that resides in every Pacific family and of course some of the best ingredients in the world.</p>
<p>“Pacific Island Food Revolution aims to return pride to the healthy food that makes up the traditional diet of the South Pacific,” he says.</p>
<p>“It takes the format of a reality television cooking competition, and uses it to reclaim the Pacific’s original cuisine.”</p>
<p>Using a challenge style, this TV show highlights programmes, initiatives and individuals already doing this, and shine a spotlight on their work while showing viewers what’s possible when using traditional foods.</p>
<p>“This is turning a mirror on Pacific culture itself and saying &#8211; actually, you have the answer.</p>
<p>“This is not agenda, it is a joyful celebration of the Pacific itself.”</p>
<p>The PIFR TV series has 12 episodes to be broadcast to more than 20 TV channels in Pacific Island countries, as well as New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>It features three teams of local cooks, who are filmed in their countries as they compete for the chance to represent their nation at regional finals in Fiji.</p>
<p>Joining Robert on this food revolution, is a line-up of co-hosts from around the Pacific, including Princess Royal Salote Mafile&#8217;o Pilolevu Tuita from the Kingdom of Tonga.</p>
<p>Much loved in the Kingdom, HRH is an advocate for organics in Tonga and has appeared with Robert Oliver speaking on this in REAL PASIFIK Tonga.</p>
<p>Fiji’s Dr Jone Hawea, a doctor with a difference, joins the co-hosts.</p>
<p>A long-time surgeon in Fiji, Jone spent years removing the limbs of fellow Fijians as they succumbed to the effects of diabetes.</p>
<p>He now heads a Healthy Living initiative in Fiji, and in 2014, Jone and Robert filmed seven healthy recipe videos for Fiji TV repeatedly played before the evening news.</p>
<p>Food entrepreneur Votausi Reur-Mckenzie from Vanuatu, known as “the Queen of Ni-Van Cuisine”, has studied as a nutritionist at Queensland University and had her “aha” moment when she realised that her own cultural cuisine ticked all the nutritional boxes she was learning about.</p>
<p>Votausi returned to Vanuatu and formed Lapita Catering, which produces food products from local crops, supplied by a network of over 1,000 farmers that she has cultivated over the years.</p>
<p>Votausi hosted REAL PASIFIKA Vanuatu with Robert and joins him again for PIFR.</p>
<p>UNICEF Ambassador Pita Taufatofa and Olympian from Tonga, also joins the co-hosts for the finals.</p>
<p>Considered a trailblazer in Samoa and great friend of Robert’s, Chef Dora Rossi makes up the final PIFR co-host.</p>
<p>Dora owns two Apia-based restaurants Milani caffè Samoa and Paddles Restaurant, which are both supplied by local organic farmers under the Farm to Table initiative created by Women in Business Development Samoa and Robert.</p>
<p>This TV series is not the first time Dora has worked alongside Robert, appearing in the Pacific TV series REAL PASIFIK Samoa, and featuring in Mea’ai Samoa.</p>
<p>Dora views being a Food Warrior and ambassador for PIFR as a huge opportunity, she says.</p>
<p>“Being a part of PIFR is a great fit, as I was born into the restaurant business and am an advocate for healthy eating and healthy living.</p>
<p>“Pacific Islands Food Revolution seemed to be the perfect opportunity to rub shoulders with Samoan home cooks.”</p>
<p>Born from a “place of kindness”, PIFR showcases food from the Pacific through the raw talent of the contestants and it is a celebration of their cooking skills and food knowledge.</p>
<p>Now is the time for this awakening and food revolution as the world becomes aware of the damage caused by unhealthy eating and lifestyles.</p>
<p>“The world is looking at more healthy ways to sustain itself,” Dora says.</p>
<p>“In light of the health crises upon us, with 75 percent of deaths in the Pacific due to NCDs, the urge to choose a healthier diet and lifestyle is a must.”</p>
<p>The benefits of cooking indigenous cuisine are tenfold, she continues.</p>
<p>A traditional Pacific diet is a healthy one, free of preservatives and harmful chemicals.</p>
<p>“Utilising traditional cooking methods is not only cheaper and convenient; it retains our identity as Pacific peoples…our food is who we are.”</p>
<p>Easy and uncomplicated sums up a lot of indigenous cuisine, such as fa&#8217;alifu ulu, Dora adds.</p>
<p>“This is a dish my late grandmother used to cook for me.</p>
<p>“It is boiled breadfruit topped with fresh coconut milk &#8211; simple and divine.”</p>
<p>For visitors, immersing oneself in any culture gives you a holistic understanding of the people, the food and the tradition of the Pacific, she adds.</p>
<p>Encouraging Pacific people to return to their indigenous foods is a major driving force behind PIFR.</p>
<p>“This way of eating is healthier than the western diet many have taken up.</p>
<p>“We hope to influence many through ‘edutainment’ – to educate while entertaining our audience.”</p>
<p>The PIFR series not only provides new awareness for its audience, but it has been an enlightening experience for Dora and the other co-hosts.</p>
<p>Although the Pacific indigenous diet and cooking methods are healthy, food and methods need to evolve to keep relevant within society, she adds.</p>
<p>“I also tasted a jackfruit curry which was divine and I had never had jackfruit in a curry before &#8211; vegetarian, innovative and just delicious.”</p>
<p>Following the official launch of PIFR on April 6, at Grand Pacific Hotel, Suva, Fiji with national and community Pacific leaders, Dora has had some time to reflect on the entire experience, which she says has been a fantastic journey.</p>

<p>“Meeting my co-hosts from Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga has been incredible; although we are from different backgrounds, we all have the same interest, which is our fight against NCDs across the region.”</p>
<p>Creator and host Robert says along with the contestants, the co-hosts are the first heroes in this revolution as they share their skills and experiences with the region.</p>
<p>“As we were filming, we felt there was a unique Pacific essence that touched our hearts and I know the audience will feel the same way,” he says.</p>
<p>In-country launch events in participating countries of Tonga, Vanuatu and Samoa followed the official launch.</p>
<p>In Samoa, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Dr Sailele Malielegaoi, government ministers, diplomats, community leaders, supporters, media and of course, PIFR co-host Dora attended the launch.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has commended the initiative at the launch, and says the programme can only strengthen and complement existing efforts in promoting healthy eating choices through the consumption of local produce.</p>
<p>“It is an educational platform and I encourage the responsible use of social median TV and radio to ignite the positive change in our meeting behaviour and a healthier Samoa campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first episode of PIFR aired across the Pacific on April 11, and Australian audiences were able to watch the series from late April.</p>
<p>Additionally, the PIFR team has also been busy creating digital food warriors around the Pacific.</p>
<p>The team will provide training on digital storytelling later this year as well as online lessons related to each PIFR episode.</p>
<p>You can sign up to become a Food Warrior via the <a href="https://www.pacificislandfoodrevolution.com/">PIFR website</a>, and receive the best recipes, watch behind the scenes actions and gain insights from the Pacific’s most inspiring people.</p>
<p>Providing strategic guidance to PIFR is a Joint Steering Committee made up of national and regional health representatives from the Pacific, which met initially in Fiji, in early April.</p>
<p>A network of organisations in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu are also monitoring the programme’s effectiveness, and it is being overseen by behavioural economists from Busara Centre.</p>
<p>The initial pilot program will receive AUD$7million from Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs &#8211; Innovation Xchange) and New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs &#8211; Aid Programme.</p>
<p>Already, Robert and his team are looking to film series two of PIFR, and applications are now open.</p>
<p>Auditions will be taking place in Samoa (May 8-9); Vanuatu (May 29-30); Tonga (June 12-13); and Fiji (July 24-25).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The food we grow up eating forms an integral part of our identity, inextricably linked with our senses. A whiff, a bite, a sip &#8211; all have the ability to evoke treasured memories which can instantaneously transport us to a different time and place. But what happens when the cuisine you know and love is not celebrated in the food culture of your own country? South Africa is one such country where local cuisine is not represented in fine dining, but a group of young talented chefs are changing that by disrupting the ‘old food culture’, bringing forth a new era that proudly honours their indigenous heritage, while also showcasing creativity and ingenuity. </em></p>
<p>By Shazia Usman</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the legacy of apartheid continues to contribute to the lack of promotion of traditional and indigenous cuisine in South Africa<em>, </em>when 26-year-old Chef Vusumuzi Ndlovu was named the 7<sup>th</sup> best young chef in a global competition, his winning dish was the talk of the town.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4092 size-full" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Chef-Vusumuzi-Ndlovu.jpg" alt="" width="753" height="757" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Chef-Vusumuzi-Ndlovu.jpg 753w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Chef-Vusumuzi-Ndlovu-150x150.jpg 150w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Chef-Vusumuzi-Ndlovu-298x300.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></p>

<p>“It was a duck which I aged for five weeks. It had grain porridge. It had heavily smoked duck leg <em>biltong</em> and pumpkin fermented in<em> umqombothi</em>.”</p>
<p>Titled <em>Isicupho</em>, this signature dish was inspired by a childhood spent on his grandmother’s farm in South Africa.</p>
<p>“Growing up on my grandmother&#8217;s farm, we used to catch birds, cook and eat them together. Every morning before we left to go play, we&#8217;d eat porridge. So I incorporated grain porridge into the dish. If I had to cook a dish for my grandmother and cousins, this is the dish I would cook for them,” said the head chef of The Marabi Club in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Choosing to honour his memories with flavours unique to South Africa, at a global stage such as the S. Pellegrino Young Chef 2018 in Milan, Italy, speaks to the depths of the pride shared by the young chef, of indigenous cuisine from his country.</p>
<p>And if the lack of emphasis on local cuisine at South African culinary schools is anything to go by, it is pride that is not shared by everyone.</p>
<p>“At chef school you’re made to feel that French cuisine is superior or you hear that the best restaurant in the world for five years running is in Denmark.”</p>
<p>In an ideal world, South Africa’s Black chefs should feel “safe to do the same and display who we are,” he says. “Those guys are great because they are honouring their heritage.”</p>
<p>Chef Ndlovu is not alone in his thinking.</p>
<p>Take Chef Nompumelelo Mqwebu, for example. Despite having been taught the classic international techniques for cooking food, this award winning chef and author, always feels the urge to recall her grandmother’s style of cooking.</p>
<p>She says, “whatever I’m making…I’ve gone back to, ‘what did my grandmother teach me? What vegetables do I remember?’ My grandmother owned a diner type restaurant and everyone cooked well at home – so I was surrounded by many who inspired me to start cooking. I started cooking at an early age and I loved entertaining at home”.</p>
<p>“We need to take pride in our own food, develop it, document and proudly share our food history with its rich heritage. It just does not make sense to say you are showcasing your country, your people and your culture, yet you lack your food identity at the heart.”</p>

<p>“I’m passionate about showing the world what fantastic talent we have in South Africa and in order to achieve the level of excellence we are capable of – funding and programmes dedicated to mentoring and up-skilling local talent is what is required,” says the author of <em>Through the Eyes of an African Chef</em>, which won the Best in the World First Book category at the renowned Gourmand World Cookbook Awards in Yantai, China last year.</p>
<p>Aside from limited focus in culinary school curriculum, there is also a lack of Black chefs owning and running top restaurants in South Africa. This means traditional and indigenous food does not make it into the South African fine-dining menus unless “appearing as a whimsical homage to a sauce, flavour or single ingredient”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The only exception is a small number of traditional restaurants in touristy Soweto in Johannesburg, casual <em>shisa nyama</em> or <em>braai </em>(barbecue) restaurants in some provinces, and <em>shebeens</em> (casual, traditionally unlicensed bars). Beloved dishes like <em>pap </em>(similar to ugali, or stiff maize meal), <em>morogo </em>(wild spinach), tripe,<em> samp</em> (hominy) and beans or “running chicken” (a free-range mature bird) stew are hard to find anywhere outside someone’s home.</p>

<p>When concerns of representation are highlighted, Black South African chefs are accused of playing the ‘race card’. This is something both Chef Loyiso Mtoba and Chef Zola Nene can attest to.</p>
<p>“Cape Town is probably the most divisive foodie city we have. Yet it’s more difficult for a Black chef to make it there than anywhere else in the country, as the culinary industry is still very much white-dominated. I lived and worked there for a time and although I was more qualified and experienced than my white colleagues, I was overlooked for a promotion,” says Chef Mtoba, who is a chef at Gemelli Cucina Bar, as well as a blogger.</p>
<p>For celebrated television chef, author and co-host of The Great South African Bake Off, Chef Nene, the discrimination lies at the intersection of race and gender.</p>
<p>“I’ve been told many times during my career that I only got to where I am because I am a Black woman,” she says. “What those people don’t understand is that I have to work twice as hard to earn any recognition because of these very stereotypes. I’m a good chef and stylist and food writer &#8211; I hate it when people undermine that.”</p>
<p>For Chef Nene, this started when she was the only Black student at her cooking school back in 2010.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-4096 size-full aligncenter" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Zola-Nene.png" alt="" width="456" height="538" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Zola-Nene.png 456w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Zola-Nene-254x300.png 254w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></p>

<p>“I remember being singled out a lot to do certain appearances because I was the only ‘token Black,’” she says. “They never used those words, but it was obvious.”</p>
<p>“Black chefs in high positions in top kitchens are like hen’s teeth,” Nene says, adding that she’s inundated with messages from Black youth who want to study but can’t afford the fees.</p>
<p>“I just wish the courses were a little more affordable. I think what we need is more funds for underprivileged youth to study at these prestigious cooking schools.”</p>
<p>Chef Nene uses her television show and Facebook to promote South African cuisine and cooking by introducing traditional meals during the show.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-4097 size-full aligncenter" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Beef-Stew.png" alt="" width="536" height="542" /></p>

<p>While chefs like Ndlovu, Mqwebu, Mtoba and Nene are part of a growing number of Black South African chefs coming out of national and international culinary schools and using their established platform to highlight lack of representation, there are home-trained chefs like young Mogau Seshoene, a Polokwane native from Limpopo Province, who have taken a slightly different route to promote South African cuisine.</p>
<p>What started out as a simple cooking lesson to teach her soon-to-married friend a few traditional dishes has today grown into something bigger than what Mogau, a former finance professional, ever expected.</p>
<p>Her start-up company, The Lazy Makoti, meaning the lazy daughter-in-law, a phrase paying a somewhat cheeky homage to its beginnings, offers cooking lessons in traditional South African cuisine to large groups of people. With the expansion of her team to four, she now also has a range of locally produced kitchen accessories; a cookbook; and dreams to eventually open a restaurant and expand across the continent.</p>
<p>“The inspiration for the company came when a friend of mine needed cooking lessons on South African cuisine, and shockingly in South Africa, she couldn&#8217;t find anywhere that offered lessons on local cuisine &#8211; only French, Italian, etc. After doing a few lessons with her I realised there was a gap in the market when word was spreading and more people were requesting lessons. I then left the corporate world where I was unhappy in order to pursue the business.”</p>
<p>The young chef, who developed her love for food while cooking with her mother, wants to preserve her heritage and culture.</p>
<p>“I enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge of South African food because it’s a dying art. As more and more young people become global citizens, there&#8217;s a big part of their heritage and culture they are losing out on. [Through my work] I would like to preserve it and continue to celebrate it,” she says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As she cooks<em> chakalaka</em>, a traditional and popular South African vegetable relish served with bread, stews, and meat, Mogau shares her elation about her cookbook, which is in its fourth reprint.</p>
<p>“It’s a collection of great South African recipes, with both modern and traditional recipes that South Africans enjoy. I am so happy that everyone will get to experience it. It’s been a long time coming.” The young entrepreneur also uses social media to engage with followers, frequently answering questions about the recipes she shares.</p>

<p>But perhaps it is Chef Mqwebu who said it best when asked to share what we can expect next from her and other Black South African chefs.</p>
<p>“I want to influence young chefs to venture into various aspects of gastronomy and hopefully, one day soon South Africa will develop a School of Gastronomy based on indigenous cuisine.”</p>
<p><em>These young and talented Black South African chefs are determined to popularise traditional and indigenous South African cuisine, giving it the respect it deserves, and why not? Because for many of them, this is where it all began.</em></p>

<p>Called Tukuni, the indigenous Fijian word for ‘storytelling’, the name pays homage to the oral tradition of the indigenous Fijians in the passing down of history, cultural traditions and knowledge from generation to generation.</p>
<p>But if you know anything about Fiji, you know that any authentic Fijian food experience is incomplete without Indo-Fijian cuisine. Indo-Fijians, or Fijians of Indian descent, have been part of Fiji’s history since 1879, when they were first brought to the country from India under the British indentured labour system.</p>
<p>Today, nearly 140 years later and despite political differences, both cultures enjoy the traditional cuisines of the other, in homes, as well as in restaurants and cafes. Tukuni embodies this culinary union skillfully through its daily-changing menu featuring delectable dishes such as <em>ika tavu</em> (smoked fish), <em>kokoda</em> (marinated fish in coconut), <em>rourou </em>(dalo leaves) and root crops, alongside free-range chicken and duck curries, Fiji’s favourite red rice, <em>dhal </em>(lentil soup) and maize <em>roti</em> (flatbread).</p>

<p>The restaurant has four chefs, women from the nearby villages who employ traditional methods of cooking, grinding spices by hand on ancient stone implements imbued with flavours from rural kitchens, and cooked over an open fire or fuel-efficient clay <em>chula</em> (fireplace).</p>
<p>And perhaps the most important aspect of it all lies in how it sources its ingredients, as this is not your average farm-to-table venture. But to tell that story and the story of how the restaurant even came into existence requires us to travel back in time, for Tukuni has a unique origin story.</p>
<p>The year was 2000, the month May. Fiji was in the grips of its third coup d&#8217;état, but unlike the other two coups in 1987, civilians led this one. With members of parliament kept hostage for 56 days; schools and businesses closed; increasing racism, violence and instability; and fear at an all time high, the country was going through one of its worst crises.</p>
<p>Frustrated and disillusioned by the political turmoil, one woman decided to change the narrative for people who were the most socially, politically and economically disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Speaking at Fiji’s first TedxSuva, Sashi Kiran shared how she followed her dream of helping others, which she hoped would inspire others to do the same.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4086 size-full" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SashiKiran.png" alt="" width="879" height="765" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SashiKiran.png 879w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SashiKiran-300x261.png 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SashiKiran-768x668.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" />Sashi Kiran, FRIEND Fiji Founder and Director, speaking at TEDxSuva.

<p>“[After the coup in 2000] I resigned from my job and made a move to living closer to communities because everything [coups] was being done in the name of communities &#8211; the grassroots. So I shifted out of Suva and to the West. Since we had been talking about economic disparity, we now needed a model that would create economic opportunity for thousands of people without having any funding. I didn&#8217;t have any resources. It was just an idea at that stage. So how do we create an economic model that gives money for thousands so that people really shift out of poverty, and along the way identifies gaps – gaps that would never again be used as an excuse for any [political] crisis? Having studied communities over a period of time we knew they had many strengths. People had food, they were growing, preserving, sustaining people in the communities for generations.”</p>
<p>In 2001 she formed a nongovernmental organisation called the Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises &amp; Development or FRIEND Fiji for short. FRIEND Fiji works directly with communities to help them recognise their strengths then provides skills, training and resources to help them step out of poverty and receive a regular and sustainable income. Setting-up systems where smallholder farmers and producers can find market and livelihood options is a key focus.</p>
<p>“So one of the first things we did was look at food we had in the market. So many things were being imported. Having grown up in the Indian culture, I knew there were lots of preserves that had long shelf life, so we called out for recipes for preserves. A lovely woman called Saras, who at that time was a caterer at events, cooking to make money, volunteered her recipe. We decided to package, market and trial her preserves. Her product was launched on International Women’s Day on 8 March 2003. It was just a model that was being tried out at that particular time. The product was great but there had to be a lot that had to be worked for the market &#8211; the planning, organising, making sure the volumes were there. So it needed a lot of training, lot of processes, all adding to the value chain. But more than anything, it needed the belief that it could be done &#8211; the social empowerment. So we worked with her and tried to make her dream [of owning her own business] come true. We worked with a whole team of people to make this project work. The product is being produced for over ten years now and has a market.”</p>
<p>By supporting Saras’ dream, FRIEND Fiji also empowered hundreds of other women who supply her with tamarind, a wild fruit in season all year-round and a key ingredient in making the preserve.</p>
<p>“Whenever the women need money, they can sell their tamarind to this process,” says Kiran.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4087 size-full" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tamarind.png" alt="" width="861" height="770" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tamarind.png 861w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tamarind-300x268.png 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tamarind-768x687.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px" />FRIEND Fiji’s preserves and chutneys are a favourite of many.

<p>Aside from preserves and chutneys, FRIEND Fiji has expanded its range of organic products to teas, flours and spices.</p>
<p>Since starting in 2001, FRIEND Fiji is now widely recognised and respected as one of the country’s most innovative enterprises. It has worked with communities on many different projects, all geared towards strengthening their resilience.</p>
<p>Tukuni is one of its latest ventures, which ensures organic farmers secure a market for their produce and where local fishermen, severely affected by Category 5 Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, are able to sell their seafood.</p>
<p>“We source our produce from organic farmers in Dreketi on Vanua Levu, as well as farmers around Lautoka and Ra on Viti Levu. We also source from our own farms. We only serve local vegetables and fruits. There are zero imported raw materials,” explained Kiran.</p>

<p>Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, chronic kidney disease and cancer, are on the rise in Fiji. Taking the lives of thousands prematurely, the Ministry of Health estimates that 80 percent<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> of deaths in Fiji are a result of NCDs, costing around $400 million<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in medical treatment annually.</p>
<p>“It’s important for this country to embrace its local and healthy foods, and Tukuni is showing the way while providing markets to farmers and local women. Our ancestors had a very beautiful and healthy diet and the people from India who came to Fiji used a lot of herbs and spices which are very healthy,” says Kiran. “We are trying to give people a taste of what used to be the beautiful traditional food.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">With the freshest organic produce, the finest cacao beans, and the hottest chili peppers, Trinidad and Tobago seems to have it all to satisfy even the most critical of palates. How does this twin-island state become a 7-time champion in the illustrious Taste of the Caribbean, and how does a country set a standard in culinary excellence unlike any other in the world?</span></em></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From high-end restaurants in Port of Spain, to the street vendors and cafeteria-style counters in Maracas Beach, Trinidad and Tobago presents the best of their bold and blended cuisine. Home of the most “sought-after street delicacy” called Doubles, and the Moruga Scorpion pepper which is ranked as the second hottest chili in the world, Trinidad and Tobago is known for its vibrant heritage, cultural diversity, and a cuisine enriched by African, Indian, Chinese, European and Middle Eastern influences. Trinbagonian cuisine is an explosion of flavors from the amalgamation of remarkable tastes from these four different continents, and it is often described as having culinary traditions that can be found nowhere else in the Caribbean.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">West African culinary traditions were brought to Trinidad and Tobago in the 1700s, while indentured servants from East India and China brought with them their distinctive spices and flavors in the 1800s. The Syrians and the Lebanese migrated to the country in the 19th century from the Ottoman empire, and colonial powers such as Spain, France, England and Holland, are part of the islands’ colorful history. If there ever was a perfect example of a ‘melting pot’, Trinidad and Tobago would be it. In fact, locals lovingly call their country “callaloo”, a famous side dish that is a delicious mash-up of different types of ingredients. In addition, with the freshest seafood and locally grown fruits and vegetables available in this pair of islands, it is like paradise for culinary professionals and food tourists. It is then no wonder for Trinidad and Tobago to win top culinary honors in this year’s Taste of the Caribbean culinary competition at the Hyatt Regency in Miami.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3659" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3659" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Callaloo-credit-OliveandMango.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Callaloo-credit-OliveandMango.jpg 800w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Callaloo-credit-OliveandMango-300x200.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Callaloo-credit-OliveandMango-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Trinbagonians love their callaloo.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association (CHTA) hosted and organized the event in Miami that brought together the best chefs and mixologists from the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bonaire, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Turks and Caicos. For the past 19 years that the Taste of the Caribbean competition has been around, Trinidad and Tobago has won the Caribbean National Team of the Year a whopping seven times. Followed by Barbados who has won three times, Trinidad and Tobago has a golden track record of winning the most number of times in this prestigious competition.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So why do they keep winning? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is clear that despite Trinidad and Tobago’s multiple levels of complexity on various levels from politics, ethnicity, and religion; there is undeniably one thing that unites all Trinbagonians &#8211; their passion for their food. There is that unique flavor, that Trini taste that can be found across the culinary board in all local dishes, and it is referred to as “green seasoning”, a special blend of chive, garlic, onion, celery, pimiento pepper, thyme and chadon beni (made from cilantro like sauce), that is slightly varied and used by professional and home cooks.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3668" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3668" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trini-green-seasoning-credit-NaturalFitFoodie.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trini-green-seasoning-credit-NaturalFitFoodie.jpg 1080w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trini-green-seasoning-credit-NaturalFitFoodie-150x150.jpg 150w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trini-green-seasoning-credit-NaturalFitFoodie-300x300.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trini-green-seasoning-credit-NaturalFitFoodie-768x768.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trini-green-seasoning-credit-NaturalFitFoodie-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">That unique Trinbagonian taste comes from this green seasoning.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With a culture that has so much love for soulful food thoughtfully cooked by grandmothers in warm and cozy kitchens, the excellent culinary DNA is part of every Trinbagonian. The people of the twin islands are protective of their culinary traditions so it makes perfect sense that a local chapter of Slow Food International exists in the country. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Active in 150 countries with over 100,000 members in 1,500 convivia or chapters, the International Slow Food Movement promotes local food and traditional cooking. Founded by Carlo Petrini in Italy in 1986, Slow Food’s philosophy is centred around three interconnected principles: food must be good, clean and fair. Basically, healthy food that has been cultivated under fair conditions and pay for the producers; and good food that has been produced without harming the environment, with a price tag that is accessible for consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Slow Food is founded upon the concept of eco-gastronomy &#8211; a compound word that encapsulates the idea of the strong connection between the plate and the planet. Local chapters like the one in Trinidad and Tobago, encourage and promote local farmers, artisans, and food through events such as shared meals, tastings, tours, workshops, discussions, festivals, and farmers’ markets.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3663" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3663" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="960" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market.jpg 960w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market-150x150.jpg 150w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market-300x300.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Greens, greens, greens!

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Part of the Slow Food Community that was launched in 2004 is the Terra Madre network, a platform that connects 2,000 food communities comprised of farmers, breeders, fishermen, cooks, academics, activists, and youth practicing small-scale and sustainable food production that is in harmony with the environment and respects indigenous knowledge. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Trinidad and Tobago, some members of the Terra Madre network include the Fondes Amandes Community Reforestation Project, Mt. Plaisir Estate Organic Producers, The Trinidad and Tobago Goat and Sheep Society (TTGSS) and organic chocolate producers such as Cocobel, a small family-run artisanal chocolate business.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3660" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3660" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-chocolates-credit-macocaribbeanliving.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1067" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-chocolates-credit-macocaribbeanliving.jpg 800w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-chocolates-credit-macocaribbeanliving-225x300.jpg 225w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-chocolates-credit-macocaribbeanliving-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cocobel chocolates.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Trinidad and Tobago’s cocoa is considered one of the best in the world. The Trinitario bean is known as a better tasting, fine-flavored cacao that commands premium prices. Trinitario is hybrid cacao and its roots began in the 16th century when local cacao beans in Trinidad were being destroyed by pests so farmers helped save the industry by introducing Alamendo cacao from the Brazilian Amazon. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is estimated that Trinitario beans comprise only 5-10% of the global cacao production, and furthermore, it has been declining for many years mainly due to the country’s dependence on the energy sector which pushed the cacao industry in the background. However, artisan bean-to-bar chocolate-makers like Cocobel are bringing life back to the dying industry in Trinidad and Tobago.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Speaking to the Caribbean Beat last year, Isabel Brash of Cocobel said, “We need farmers and chocolate makers to work together. I would love to see more and more younger people with great business minds getting into cocoa farming, and having direct relationships with chocolate makers.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3661" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3661" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-Isabel-Brash-credit-Uni-West-Indies.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="617" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-Isabel-Brash-credit-Uni-West-Indies.jpg 800w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-Isabel-Brash-credit-Uni-West-Indies-300x231.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cocobel-Isabel-Brash-credit-Uni-West-Indies-768x592.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Isabel Brash, Founder of Cocobel Chocolates.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Other similar-minded chocolate-makers who believe that they can help stimulate agriculture into their communities are other players in the market in this rapidly growing sector like Tamana Mountain Chocolate and Sun Eaters Organics. Tamana Mountain Chocolate is located in the remote village of Mundo Nuevo in the hills of Trinidad, while Sun Eaters Organics works with plantations like the La Reunion Estate in Caroni, near the foothills of the Northern Range of Trinidad. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To motivate and uplift organic farming, Sun Eaters Organics pays at least 60% higher than the market price for organic cacao beans. The La Reunion Estate was established in the 1940s for cacao research and is managed by the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Fisheries. The Estate quite simply produces the highest quality of organic Trinitario beans, and have unfailingly received global recognition time and again from institutions like the Salon du Chocolat in Paris and the Academy of Chocolate in the UK.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sun Eaters Organics believes in ethical and sustainable production within the cacao industry, and its founder, Gillian Goddard, is a self-proclaimed activist and changemaker. She is also the Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Alliance of Rural Communities in Trinidad and Tobago (ARCTT), an NGO that supports and develops financially independent community-owned rural businesses, including the incubation of said businesses by teaching them how to make artisanal chocolates.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Goddard was interviewed by the Caribbean Beat on the chocolate revolution that is positively shaking up Trinidad and Tobago, &#8220;Now that the communities are making chocolate, they have an opportunity to be involved in something which requires communication, co-operation, and attention to detail close to home.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the country’s capital, Port of Spain, ARCTT started offering a two-hour chocolate tour showcasing indigenous chocolate production where the main highlight is Trinidad and Tobago’s artisan chocolates made from their very own Trinitario beans in February of this year.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3658" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3658" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-tour-credit-Newsday.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-tour-credit-Newsday.jpg 1200w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-tour-credit-Newsday-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-tour-credit-Newsday-768x576.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-tour-credit-Newsday-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ARCTT tour in Port of Spain.

<div id="attachment_3657" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3657" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-chocolate-tour-credit-stampedandsolo.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="600" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-chocolate-tour-credit-stampedandsolo.jpg 1000w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-chocolate-tour-credit-stampedandsolo-300x180.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ARCTT-chocolate-tour-credit-stampedandsolo-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Alliance of Rural Communities Chocolate Tour. CREDIT: Stamped and Solo.</p></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">ARCTT is planning on offering longer tours in Trinidad and Tobago’s chocolate-making villages and cacao plantations. Goddard told Newsday, “What we’re trying to do is get people to spend money on local chocolate. When you circulate money within your community it makes a big difference.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another way that ARCTT works with the community is by working with farmers to prepare 100% organic Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) baskets every other week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CSA is a system connecting producers and consumers closely by getting consumers to subscribe to the harvest of a group of farms. In Trinidad, The Green Market has a CSA program started in 2014, where families support farmers through monthly subscriptions paid in advance. This direct connection enables farmers, growers, and consumers to become more educated in improving their food supply, health, and environment.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3669" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3669" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trinidad-chocolates-credit-Vegout.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="728" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trinidad-chocolates-credit-Vegout.jpg 960w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trinidad-chocolates-credit-Vegout-300x228.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Trinidad-chocolates-credit-Vegout-768x582.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chocolates locally made in Trinidad and Tobago during the ARCTT tour.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Green Market in Santa Cruz opened in 2012 on 3/4 acres that is part of a five-acre farm owned by Wendell Mottley and Vicki Assevero. They are strong proponents of Ecoliteracy where communities collectively share information and take action to foster sustainable living, and Ecosophy, a philosophy that believes agriculture should become the foundational sector of a successful Trinbagonian economy where healthier food is produced and the food import bill is reduced.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Committed to building a community of eco-conscious consumers, The Green Market organizes a number of activities and events. On Saturdays is The Green Market’s Farmers’ market where one can find fresh produce, cooked food, land-based artisanal food and crafts, and their Edible Talks. On Sundays, they have morning cooking demos where professional and amateur chefs teach people how to create tasty and nutritious meals, making a point that the best food comes from chemical-free, garden-grown fresh produce. In addition, The Green Market continues to work with farmers to eliminate the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and genetically modified seeds.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3662" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3662" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market-entreps-teach-sustainability.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market-entreps-teach-sustainability.jpg 800w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market-entreps-teach-sustainability-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-The-Green-Market-entreps-teach-sustainability-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Entrepreneurs teach each other sustainability practices at Trinidad&#8217;s Green Market during one of their Edible Talks.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Again we ask, why do they keep winning? Well Trinidad and Tobago shows us that having islands that enjoy a tropical climate with lush vegetation all year round, with people deeply connected to their environment who are protective of their culinary traditions, and infused with a kaleidoscopic tapestry of mixed influences and cultures; are the ingredients that make up the perfect pot of culinary excellence.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">There has been an unprecedented increase of proudly Moroccan female chefs domestically and abroad, fearlessly and innovatively creating modern interpretations of Moroccan cuisine, and supporting small producers by using only fresh local produce and ingredients in their female-led kitchens.</span></em></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Considered one of the finest in the world and referred to as “a cuisine of the kings”, Moroccan cuisine has been gradually enriched over the centuries because of multiple cultural influences; strictly refined in the royal palaces of Fez, Meknes, Marrakech and Rabat; and lovingly shared and taught by mothers to their daughters in warm kitchens across this North African country.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3623" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3623" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Moroccan-Soup-credit-Theblondeabroad.com-KierstenRich.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Moroccan-Soup-credit-Theblondeabroad.com-KierstenRich.jpg 2048w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Moroccan-Soup-credit-Theblondeabroad.com-KierstenRich-300x200.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Moroccan-Soup-credit-Theblondeabroad.com-KierstenRich-768x512.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Moroccan-Soup-credit-Theblondeabroad.com-KierstenRich-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Moroccan Soup.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Morocco is abundant with many fine ingredients and spices, in fact the famous Moroccan spice mix, <i>Ras el hanout</i>, consists of twenty seven spices combined to give marinades and dishes that distinct explosion of flavours. Meals are also communal in nature, and their staple dish<i> tagine</i> for example, is shared from a single clay pot. In most cultures around the world, food takes centre stage and brings together families and communities. This is also true for Morocco where it is inherently part of the culture for grandmothers and mothers to lovingly bond with their daughters in the kitchen, teaching them how to cook traditional Moroccan meals.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Although men dominate the world’s commercial kitchens as known top chefs, it is undoubtedly the women that cultivate cuisines. In Morocco, like in many other parts of the world, it is rather uncommon to find female chefs commanding professional commercial kitchens. However, change is finally happening.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Chefs Hanane Ouaddahou, Najat Kaanache, and Meryem Cherkaoui are disrupting the international culinary scene. Not all grew up in the streets of Morocco, but all carry a love for their homeland that manifests in their work. Having a food-oriented family, a strong sense of identity, and a desire to popularize Moroccan cuisine using local produce, ingredients, and spices; are three things that these three famous female chefs have in common.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Born and raised in Casablanca, Chef Hanane Ouaddahou left Morocco when she was 17 years old. She studied in Paris at a business school where she learned all about auditing and cost controlling. She worked as a business intelligence consultant for many years before finally fulfilling her dream of opening a restaurant. Ouaddahou reminisces, “As a young girl I was always in the kitchen, learning cooking from my mother and my grandma.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">She opened <i>La Marocaine</i> (The Moroccan) when her son was 6 months old, and she pretty much did everything. From managing, being the waitress and a chef, Ouaddahou ran the restaurant in France for two years. During the financial crisis, she sold the restaurant to another Moroccan family, and her and the family moved to Dubai where her husband got a job.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3626" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3626" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Hanane-Ouaddahou-v2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="767" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Hanane-Ouaddahou-v2.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Hanane-Ouaddahou-v2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Hanane-Ouaddahou-v2-768x575.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chef Hanane Ouaddahou.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Dubai, she offered cooking classes and started catering. With a mission to popularize Moroccan cuisine in her mind, during a holiday in Morocco, inspiration struck. While watching <i>Fatafea</i>t, the Middle East television station dedicated to everything culinary. Through her father’s advice, she contacted the founder of <i>Fatafeat</i>, Youssef El Deeb, and told him she wanted to share her Moroccan kitchen as it was not very well known in the United Arab Emirates. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fast forward and Ouaddahou now flies weekly to Cairo to go live on air in the cookery segment of Al Qahera Al Youm. Having lived in Dubai for five years now, this hardworking chef and mother of two has become one of the Middle East’s most popular television chefs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Unlike Ouaddahou, Chef Najat Kaanache grew up in a small village in Spain but every summer her family would drive back to Taza, the mountain village in Morocco they had left. And although Spain was her home, she was undoubtedly Moroccan in every way. &#8220;&#8216;Moroccan&#8217; is something you carry with you, that&#8217;s inside you, that&#8217;s a feeling,” Kaanache says.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3628" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3628" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-credit-Cacao-Collective-from-Najat-Kanaache.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1182" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-credit-Cacao-Collective-from-Najat-Kanaache.jpg 1000w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-credit-Cacao-Collective-from-Najat-Kanaache-254x300.jpg 254w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-credit-Cacao-Collective-from-Najat-Kanaache-768x908.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-credit-Cacao-Collective-from-Najat-Kanaache-866x1024.jpg 866w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chef Najat Kanaache.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was in the Netherlands when she realized her passion was for cooking when she started supplying small bites in art gallery shows. Her professional culinary journey has since been a dizzying and exciting ride, from becoming a head chef at a seafood restaurant in Rotterdam, to working in some of the world’s best like The French Laundry. She runs a Moroccan grill restaurant in Mexico City called <i>Cus</i>, with her life and business partner, Charles Accivatti. Aspiring to create the best modern Moroccan restaurant in the world, Kaanache bought <i>Nur</i> in 2017, a restaurant at the Medina in Fez. At <i>Nur,</i> Kaanache brings to life all of the flavours that she remembers from her childhood summers in Taza, and adds a modern twist to what is traditionally Moroccan.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3631" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3631" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-masterclass-March2018-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-masterclass-March2018-2.jpg 1920w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-masterclass-March2018-2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-masterclass-March2018-2-768x432.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Najat-Kanaache-masterclass-March2018-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chef Najat Kanaache with her students at a master class. CREDIT: Najat Kanaache.</p></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Nur</i> has a very strong focus on using daily fresh market seafood and local produce. The restaurant also regularly hosts events and actively participates in projects such as Pop Up Chefs or the Chefs in Residence experience where incoming chefs get to work with the country’s wealth of produce, herbs and spices while working with Moroccan farmers and producers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another celebrated Moroccan chef is Meryem Cherkaoui, a Rabat native that received her training at the renowned Institut Paul Bocuse in Lyon, France. After working in illustrious restaurants in France such as The Majestic and The Crillon, she moved back to Casablanca in 2003 to start her own restaurant, the <i>Maison du Gourmet</i>. Seven years later she began offering her consulting services through <i>Saveurs des Chefs</i>, where until now, she teaches catering professionals through cooking workshops.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Merkaoui proudly supports agribusiness companies in the development of their products, and through another company of hers, <i>Dima Terroir</i>, improves the livelihoods of Moroccan women by sourcing the finest products by working in partnership with local women’s cooperatives. In 2013, she founded Slow Food Maroc (Slow Food Morocco) with Zoubida Charrouf, coordinator of the 10,000 Gardens in Africa project. In the same year, it is through this connection that Cherkaoui met Dounia Bennani and Nadia Benmoussa, particularly through the Slow Food Alliance of Chefs project.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3632" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3632" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Meryem-Cherkaou-Lunch-MesLala-Mandarin-Oriental-credit-Meryem-Cherkaoui.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Meryem-Cherkaou-Lunch-MesLala-Mandarin-Oriental-credit-Meryem-Cherkaoui.jpg 1280w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Meryem-Cherkaou-Lunch-MesLala-Mandarin-Oriental-credit-Meryem-Cherkaoui-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Meryem-Cherkaou-Lunch-MesLala-Mandarin-Oriental-credit-Meryem-Cherkaoui-768x576.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Meryem-Cherkaou-Lunch-MesLala-Mandarin-Oriental-credit-Meryem-Cherkaoui-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lunch at The Mandarin Oriental&#8217;s MesLala.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bennani and Benmoussa were so impressed with Cherkaoui that they joined forces to open their own retaurant, <i>Ch’hiwates du Terroir.</i> Although Dounia began her career as a manager in an accountancy firm, and Nadia was an architect and decorator, they had a similar dream of promoting the richness and diversity of local Moroccan produce. Because of this <i>Ch’hiwates du Terroir </i>has an organic menu based on local produce; fresh meat and fish are bought from shops in their neighborhood in Rabat; cheeses are from a local cooperative; fresh produce comes from the Moroccan fair trade platform, Taswiq; and herbs are naturally grown by Nadia in her eco-agricultural farm in Shoul. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>Ch’hiwates du Terroir </i>has even recruited a female chef, Chef Couad, who used to be a housewife. Seeing all these Moroccan women flourishing in their professional careers, and extending their success to cooperatives, farmers and other small producers is a positive trend. According to the World Bank, women make up less than 30 per cent of Morocco’s labour force, so for a country where women used to only have very limited and conservative choices, times are definitely changing. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Marrakech’s Gueliz neighborhood, an outdoor café called the Amal Women’s Training Centre, is a restaurant training institute for Moroccan women with little to no income who are single mothers, female orphans, divorcees and widows. &#8220;They&#8217;re like this category that society wishes would be invisible,&#8221; says Nora Fitzgerald, the Training Centre’s founder.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3635" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3635" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="803" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-1.jpg 1200w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-1-300x201.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-1-768x514.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-1-1024x685.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The all-female team at Amal. CREDIT: Amal Women’s Training Centre.</p></div>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These invisible women are treated as outcasts and pariahs in Moroccan society, and such an opportunity to gain culinary skills to get full time jobs in restaurants and hotels after being trained in one of two branches of the Training Centre, is like getting a second chance at life. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fitzgerald was born in Morocco to American parents, and she set up the Amal Women’s Training Centre in 2013, after having numerous encounters with a young mother begging in the streets on her daily walks to the school where her daughter goes to. She started small by teaching this young mother and other women how to bake all sorts of goodies which were sold at local bake sales. From there, the dream and the vision grew, and after receiving a large grant from the Drosos Foundation in Switzerland, the Training Centre fully opened its doors as a non-profit organisation.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3636" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3636" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="724" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-2.jpg 1000w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-2-300x217.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-2-768x556.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Some of the women at the centre.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Dedicated to the empowerment of marginalised women through restaurant training and job placement, the centre has trained more than 200 women as of mid 2018. And chefs such as Chef Jamila Aamer has mentored over 100 apprentices there who have moved on to securing jobs and living better lives. The Training Centre and outdoor café serves a growing number of customers traditional Moroccan favourites such as a variety of <i>tagines, zaalouks</i> and their popular icy blended mint lemonade.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_3639" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-3639" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-4-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-4-1.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Credit-Amal-Non-Profit-4-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Traditional Moroccan dish at the Amal Women&#8217;s Training Centre.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is an African proverb that says, “if you educate a man, you educate an individual. But if you educate a woman, you educate a nation.” At the helm of these professional kitchens, restaurant institutes, and slow food movements in Morocco are these trailblazing women who are creating more opportunities and possibilities for others. All the more validation to this proverb, as well as the undeniable current statistics and research stating that an educated woman is better able to educate her own children, and have a healthier family, leading to greater wealth in her community. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It looks like Morocco is being steered in the right direction by women in a white <i>toque blanche</i>; armed with a collection of sharp knives; and using only the freshest local produce in the hearth of Morocco’s finest kitchens.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Everything you could possibly want to know about food in Africa will be showcased at the upcoming Food Africa 2018, in Cairo, Egypt on December 8-10.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether you are a foodie, or in the food business, Food Africa is an excellent opportunity to network, learn more about food and agro-industries and try locally-sourced and prepared foods by top Chefs at the live cooking show. This exploration and celebration of African cuisine and what makes it unique will see it pushed to the forefront of people’s minds and into the Western mainstream…</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Come December, Africa in all its culinary glory, will be on display at Food Africa. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After three successful editions, Food Africa, the continent’s largest International Trade Exhibition specialised in the food and agro-industries, will return from December 8 to 10, 2018.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3454 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-3-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-3-768x576.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fittingly, it is to be staged in the bustling heart of the Egyptian capital Cairo. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a steadily increasing youthful population of approximately 96 million people, Egypt remains the largest consumer market in North Africa.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Egypt is also the gateway to the African market; in fact, agriculture and agro-processing across Africa is set to witness an increase of $204 billion by 2025. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Food Africa will pinpoint key opportunities in the agro-food sector, and provide regional and international stakeholders with direct access to the Egyptian mega-market and Africa’s flourishing agriculture industry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Combining an innovative format of showcasing, networking, and matchmaking, the show attracts wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and other industry professionals, and offers specialised platforms and business solutions including a Hosted Buyers Programme.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This specialised Business-to-Business platform is developed with a primary focus on building bridges between buyers, vendors, and traders from across the region and beyond to facilitate business undertakings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It also allows guest buyers to explore a diverse range of products and negotiate contracts on the spot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, one of the main attractions of Food Africa is the action-packed Live Cooking Show. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3457 size-full" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-6.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-6.jpg 1280w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-6-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-6-768x576.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-6-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Powered by the Egyptian Chefs Association (ECA), this dynamic show sets the stage for internationally-famed Chefs to employ their culinary skills and prepare unique recipes in front of a live audience, each day of the exhibition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The show is streamed live on large screens for all visitors to enjoy, and the resulting recipes are collected in a special cookbook to be distributed to them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Executive Director for ECA Mirjam van Ijssel says the three-day live cooking show features eight talented Egyptian Chefs, who will share their experience and expertise with Food Africa visitors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We have two celebrity Chefs appearing at the show this year, along with young budding Chefs, who are keen to show off their talents,” Mirjam says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the Chefs due to feature at Food Africa are currently being confirmed, what is certain is the dishes they will prepare and present at the live show will contain flavours and ingredients typical of Egypt.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Often very traditional dishes are presented but they have a contemporary twist,” Mirjam adds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Dishes presented will also showcase foods on show throughout the Food Africa exhibition &#8211; such as dates, honey, Tilapia, pulses, raisins, Egyptian cheeses and herbs and spices – there are savoury and sweet dishes, it is a taste sensation.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In general, Egyptian cuisine makes heavy use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume">legumes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable">vegetables</a> and fruit from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</a>&#8216;s rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_Valley">Nile Valley</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_Delta">Delta</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It shares similarities with the food of the Eastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</a> region, such as rice-stuffed vegetables, grape leaves, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawerma">shawerma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab">kebab</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofta">kofta</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Examples of Egyptian dishes include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ful_medames">ful medames</a>, mashed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fava_bean">fava beans</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushari">kushari</a>, lentils and pasta; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulukhiyya">molokhiya</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_okra">bush okra</a> stew. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3455 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-4-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-4-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-4-768x576.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pita bread, known locally as eish baladi is a staple of Egyptian cuisine, and cheesemaking in Egypt dates back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Dynasty_of_Egypt">First Dynasty of Egypt</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domiati">domiati</a> being the most popular type of cheese consumed today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Common meats in Egyptian cuisine are rabbit, pigeon, chicken, and duck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lamb and beef are frequently used for grilling, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offal">offal</a> is a popular fast food in cities and foie gras is a delicacy that has been prepared in the region since at least 2500 BCE. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fish and seafood are common in Egypt&#8217;s coastal regions but a significant amount of Egyptian cuisine is vegetarian, due to both the historically high price of meat and the needs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_christians">Coptic Christian</a> community, whose religious restrictions require essentially vegan diets for much of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Egypt&#8217;s Red Sea ports were the main points of entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_trade">spices to Europe</a> and easy access to various spices has, throughout the years, left its mark on Egyptian cuisine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumin">Cumin</a> is the most commonly used spice, while other common spices include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander">coriander</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom">cardamom</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper">chili</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniseed">aniseed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_leaves">bay leaves</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dill">dill</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsley">parsley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger">ginger</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon">cinnamon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamiaceae">mint</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloves">cloves</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Popular desserts in Egypt include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baqlawa">baqlawa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basbousa">basbousa</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanafeh">kunafa</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mirjam says interest levels in sourcing and eating local and traditional foods has increased dramatically throughout Egypt, mainly due to a deep resurgence of national pride following the January 25 Revolution in 2011.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3456 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-5-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-5-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-5-768x576.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The 2011 Egyptian Revolution took place across all of Egypt, and was organised by various youth groups as a statement against increasing police brutality during the last few years of former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_President">Egyptian President</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a>’s term in office.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Egyptian protesters&#8217; grievances focused on legal and political issues and violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in approximately 850 people killed and over 6,000 injured. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak">Mubarak</a>’s Government was dissolved, and overtime, Egyptians have found a renewed sense of national pride in their country, its culture and traditions. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Like most countries, a huge part of its cultural heritage is food: how and where it is grown; how it is prepared and presented; and of course, where it is eaten, and with whom. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“The country has witnessed a nationalistic drive resulting in many proud Egyptians wanting to showcase their unique cuisine,” Mirjam says. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Two great samples of this culinary trend are <a href="http://www.zoobaeats.com/"><span class="s2">Zooba</span></a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CairoKitchen/"><span class="s2">Cairo Kitchen</span></a>, two restaurants which sell Egyptian street food in a contemporary and clean style. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Zooba is especially popular and is a true success story – it has branches opening outside Egypt in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, New York and London in the near future.” </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A celebration of Egyptian street food culture, Zooba believes Egyptian street food rivals the best in the world. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Its high quality selection of breads, ful, taamia, koshari and meats are all sourced from local markets and free of preservatives and additives.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3459 size-large" src="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-8-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-8-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-8-300x225.jpg 300w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-8-768x576.jpg 768w, http://chefs4dev.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Food-Africa-8.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Mirjam explains Egyptians seemed to lack behind their close neighbours, the Lebanese, who have proven to be very successful in promoting their cuisine abroad by opening eateries. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“This is what we now see the Syrians doing well currently,” she adds.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">However, this is changing as Egyptians become more committed to stamp Egypt’s mark on the culinary world map.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Within the country itself, more and more resort hotels in destinations such as </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Hurghada , Sharm El Sheikh and Marsa Alam are opening an Egyptian restaurant. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“This allows tourists to sample locally-sourced fare, prepared traditionally and enjoy a taste of Egypt during their holidays.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The other movement occurring in Egypt currently – just as in many other countries – is the demand for organic and whole foods, sourced locally. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“There is awareness about the importance of healthy and wholesome local foods, and demand is growing.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“More people are seeking local organic products and also traditional food products from Egypt’s different regions,”Mirjam adds.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Following the success of the 2017 Food Africa, where 294 exhibitors were present across 10,000 Square metres of exhibition space frequented by nealy 11,000 visitors, organisers anticipate another great spectacle during December 8-10 at Cairo International Convention and Exhibition Centre. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year’s edition of Food Africa saw the introduction of Egypt Food Avenue &#8211; a platform for Egyptian SMEs and new exporters to expand their businesses, as well as Sea Food Africa &#8211; a specialised section dedicated entirely to fish and seafood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given African dishes are still woefully under-represented on the world culinary scene, Food Africa is an opportunity to learn more about the ingredients that make up this unique cuisine, and how you can utilise them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The live cooking show will give attendees the chance to see how traditional food is best prepared, while being able to taste samples of the creations from some of Egypt’s top established and budding Chefs. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From the humble maize/grain porridges and root vegetables forming the basis of so many diets, to grand feasting dishes such as breyanis, tagines, stews and aromatic curries, Africa&#8217;s favourite foods offer something for every palate.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">For businesses, Food Africa also offers opportunities to directly engage with future customers in their own environment; enables you to launch to new markets and establish new business connections; meet new prospective buyers and suppliers and present your new products to existing clients; and position your business amidst the greatest concentration of buyers in one place. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">At Food Africa, attendees can sign contracts and agreements with buyer groups on location; find reliable agents and distributors; exchange experiences and insights with local professionals; gain increased visibility in East Africa especially the COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) region; and discover new market trends and technologies in the African food industry. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Food Africa is a delight for the senses and whatever your reason is for visiting the show, you will enjoy Egypt and Africa’s amazing cuisine being showcased at the exhibition. </span></p>
